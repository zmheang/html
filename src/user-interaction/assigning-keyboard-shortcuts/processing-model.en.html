  <p>An element's <dfn>assigned access key</dfn> is a key combination derived from the element's
  <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> content attribute. Initially, an element must not
  have an <span>assigned access key</span>.</p>

  <p>Whenever an element's <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute is set, changed,
  or removed, the user agent must update the element's <span>assigned access key</span> by running
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the element has no <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute, then skip
   to the <i>fallback</i> step below.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, <span data-x="split a string on ASCII whitespace">split the attribute's value
   on ASCII whitespace</span>, and let <var>keys</var> be the resulting tokens.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each value in <var>keys</var> in turn, in the order the tokens appeared in the
    attribute's value, run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the value is not a string exactly one Unicode code point in length, then skip the
     remainder of these steps for this value.</p></li>

     <li><p>If the value does not correspond to a key on the system's keyboard, then skip the
     remainder of these steps for this value.</p></li>

     <li><p>If the user agent can find a mix of zero or more modifier keys that, combined with the
     key that corresponds to the value given in the attribute, can be used as the access key, then
     the user agent may assign that combination of keys as the element's <span>assigned access
     key</span> and abort these steps.
     <!--INSERT FINGERPRINT-->
     </p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p><i>Fallback</i>: Optionally, the user agent may assign a key combination of its choosing
   as the element's <span>assigned access key</span> and then abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If this step is reached, the element has no <span>assigned access key</span>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>Once a user agent has selected and assigned an access key for an element, the user agent should
  not change the element's <span>assigned access key</span> unless the <code
  data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> content attribute is changed or the element is moved to
  another <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>When the user presses the key combination corresponding to the <span>assigned access key</span>
  for an element, if the element <span data-x="concept-command">defines a command</span>, the
  command's <span data-x="command-facet-HiddenState">Hidden State</span> facet is false (visible),
  the command's <span data-x="command-facet-DisabledState">Disabled State</span> facet is also false
  (enabled), the element is <span>in a document</span> that has a <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>, and neither the element nor any of its
  ancestors has a <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute specified, then the user agent
  must trigger the <span data-x="command-facet-Action">Action</span> of the command.</p>

  <p class="note">User agents <a href="#expose-commands-in-ui">might expose</a> elements that have
  an <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> attribute in other ways as well, e.g. in a menu
  displayed in response to a specific key combination.</p> <!-- the actual conformance criteria for
  this is in the section that defines commands -->

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-accessKey">accessKey</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code data-x="attr-accesskey">accesskey</code> content attribute.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-accessKeyLabel">accessKeyLabel</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return
  a string that represents the element's <span>assigned access key</span>, if any. If the element
  does not have one, then the IDL attribute must return the empty string.</p>
