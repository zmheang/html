<!-- v2: ideas for drag and drop:

     * being able to animate a drop target:

       > To implement this with simple interface I've proposed, events should be handled either by
       > existing elements (like list items that compare their size and position of dragged element
       > to decide whether element should be dropped before or after) or handled by container that
       > would probably need to calculate positions of it's children and create new element to show
       > drop target. Smooth Mac-like drag'n'drop can be implemented by animating drop target's
       > padding/margin. So that's quite a bit of code that's going to be reinvented each time
       > someone implements reordering.

       <hyatt> :droptarget
       <hyatt> or something
       <hyatt> we don't support a pseudo-class for the drop target but that's a great idea
       <Hixie_> yeah, thinking about that too
       <Hixie_> :drop-target, :drop-target(above), :drop-target(below) and having ondragover be able to say "not on me, but next to me maybe"

       - some way to be able to match an element that is being dragged over.

       - some way to be able to animate an element as it goes into and out of this state (CSS
         transitions?), e.g. to be able to animate something "getting out of the way" to let you
         drop an item between others.

       - as an extension to the previous feature, a way to distinguish being dragged above or to the
         left of the drag target vs below or to the right of the drag target.

     * We should let drop targets communicate back to drag sources if they want to communicate.
       (e.g. expose Window, and thus postMessage(), on the dataTransfer object on drop.) Or maybe
       just use a MessagePort!

       We should let drag sources provide a set of options via a context menu when the drop happens.
       (So that, e.g., the source can know whether a capabilities URI that it is passing along is
       supposed to be read-write access or read-only access to the object being dragged.)

       We should let potential drop targets see the types (but not the contents!) of dragged data so
       they can establish if they care or not. (dataTransfer.hasType())

       Ack: Ben Laurie (@g)

     * Interop with native apps. In particular, we probably want to safelist the list of types that
       a Web page can see, since otherwise we'll end up exposing things like the username (if a user
       drags a file from their desktop, the path is exposed on some OSes).

     * Alex Velkov suggests that drags to and from the same origin should be able to read the data
       even before the drop.

     Other things listed below:
      DND-v2: more native support: text/html from selections, etc
      DND-v3: add Blob support
      DND-v4: add structured clone support
      DND-v5: add promises (should be able to say "if you accept this
              drop, then I can provide the File object that
              corresponds to it eventually")

         DataTransferPromise.type = 'string' or 'file' or 'blob' or 'data'
                            .onneeddata - can wait until this fires to provide data
                            .setData() - call this once you have data, must be the right type

  <p>This section defines an event-based drag-and-drop mechanism.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define exactly what a <em>drag-and-drop operation</em> actually
  is.</p>

  <p>On a visual medium with a pointing device, a drag operation could be the default action of a
  <code data-x="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> event that is followed by a series of <code
  data-x="event-mousemove">mousemove</code> events, and the drop could be triggered by the mouse
  being released.</p>

  <p>When using an input modality other than a pointing device, users would probably have to
  explicitly indicate their intention to perform a drag-and-drop operation, stating what they wish
  to drag and where they wish to drop it, respectively.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>However it is implemented, drag-and-drop operations must have a starting point (e.g. where the
  mouse was clicked, or the start of the selection or element that was selected for the drag), may
  have any number of intermediate steps (elements that the mouse moves over during a drag, or
  elements that the user picks as possible drop points as they cycle through possibilities), and must
  either have an end point (the element above which the mouse button was released, or the element
  that was finally selected), or be canceled. The end point must be the last element selected as a
  possible drop point before the drop occurs (so if the operation is not canceled, there must be at
  least one element in the middle step).</p>

  </div>
