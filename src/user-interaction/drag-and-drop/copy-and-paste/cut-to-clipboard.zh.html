  <h5>Cut to clipboard</h5>

  <p>When the user invokes a cut operation, the user agent must act as if the user had invoked a
  copy operation (see the previous section), followed, if the copy was completed successfully, by <a
  href="#contenteditable-delete">a selection delete operation</a>.</p>

  <p>The events involved in this process are the <code data-x="event-dnd-dragstart">dragstart</code>,
  <code data-x="event-dnd-drag">drag</code>, and <code data-x="event-dnd-dragend">dragend</code> events.</p>
