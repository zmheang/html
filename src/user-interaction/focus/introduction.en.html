  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>An HTML user interface typically consists of multiple interactive widgets, such as form
  controls, scrollable regions, links, dialog boxes, browser tabs, and so forth. These widgets form
  a hierarchy, with some (e.g. browser tabs, dialog boxes) containing others (e.g. links, form
  controls).</p>

  <p>When interacting with an interface using a keyboard, key input is channeled from the system,
  through the hierarchy of interactive widgets, to an active widget, which is said to be
  <span>focused</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider an HTML application running in a browser tab running in a graphical environment.
   Suppose this application had a page with some text controls and links, and was currently showing
   a modal dialog, which itself had a text control and a button.</p>

   <p>The hierarchy of focusable widgets, in this scenario, would include the browser window, which
   would have, amongst its children, the browser tab containing the HTML application. The tab itself
   would have as its children the various links and text controls, as well as the dialog. The dialog
   itself would have as its children the text control and the button.</p>

   paragraph, in graphical form -->

   <p>If the widget with <span data-x="focused">focus</span> in this example was the text control in
   the dialog box, then key input would be channeled from the graphical system to &#x2460; the web
   browser, then to &#x2461; the tab, then to &#x2462; the dialog, and finally to &#x2463; the text
   control.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Keyboard <em>events</em> are always targeted at this <span>focused</span> element.</p>
