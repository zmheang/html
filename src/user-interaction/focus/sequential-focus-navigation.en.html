  <h4><dfn>Sequential focus navigation</dfn></h4>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> has a <dfn>sequential focus navigation order</dfn>, which orders some
  or all of the <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> in the <code>Document</code>
  relative to each other. The order in the <span>sequential focus navigation order</span> does not
  have to be related to the <span>tree order</span> in the <code>Document</code> itself. If a
  <span>focusable area</span> is omitted from the <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>
  of its <code>Document</code>, then it is unreachable via <span>sequential focus
  navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>There can also be a <dfn>sequential focus navigation starting point</dfn>. It is initially
  unset. The user agent may set it when the user indicates that it should be moved.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, the user agent could set it to the position of the user's click if
  the user clicks on the document contents.</p>

  <p>When the user requests that focus move from the <span>currently focused area of a top-level
  browsing context</span> to the next or previous <span>focusable area</span> (e.g. as the default action
  of pressing the <kbd><kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> key), or when the user requests that focus sequentially move to a
  <span>top-level browsing context</span> in the first place (e.g. from the browser's location bar),
  the user agent must use the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>starting point</var> be the <span>currently focused area of a top-level
   browsing context</span>, if the user requested to move focus sequentially from there, or else the
   <span>top-level browsing context</span> itself, if the user instead requested to move focus from
   outside the <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is a <span>sequential focus navigation starting point</span> defined and it is
   inside <var>starting point</var>, then let <var>starting point</var> be the <span>sequential
   focus navigation starting point</span> instead.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>direction</var> be <i>forward</i> if the user requested the <em>next</em>
    control, and <i>backward</i> if the user requested the previous control.</p>

    <p class="note">Typically, pressing <kbd><kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> requests the next control, and pressing
    <kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> requests the previous control.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p><i>Loop</i>: Let <var>selection mechanism</var> be <i>sequential</i> if the <var>starting
    point</var> is a <span>browsing context</span> or if <var>starting point</var> is in its
    <code>Document</code>'s <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, <var>starting point</var> is not in its <code>Document</code>'s
    <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>; let <var>selection mechanism</var> be
    <i>DOM</i>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var>candidate</var> be the result of running the <span>sequential navigation search
   algorithm</span> with <var>starting point</var>, <var>direction</var>, and <var>selection
   mechanism</var> as the arguments.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>candidate</var> is not null, then run the <span>focusing steps</span> for
   <var>candidate</var> and return.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, unset the <span>sequential focus navigation starting point</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>starting point</var> is the <span>top-level browsing context</span>, or a
    <span>focusable area</span> in the <span>top-level browsing context</span>, the user agent
    should transfer focus to its own controls appropriately (if any), honouring
    <var>direction</var>, and then return.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, if <var>direction</var> is <i>backward</i>, then the last
    focusable control before the browser's rendering area would be the control to focus.</p>

    <p>If the user agent has no focusable controls &mdash; a kiosk-mode browser, for instance
    &mdash; <!--and <var>starting point</var> is not the <span>top-level browsing context</span>,-->
    then the user agent may instead restart these steps with the <var>starting point</var> being the
    <span>top-level browsing context</span> itself.</p>

    <!-- in theory, the top-level browsing context _always_ has at least one focusable area: the
    viewport. Even a "blocked by a modal dialog" doesn't disable the viewport (since the Document is
    its DOM anchor, and the Document isn't made inert by "blocked by a modal dialog"). Note that
    nested browsing contexts can have inert viewports, though (if the browsing context container
    itself is inert, for example) -->

   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, <var>starting point</var> is a <span>focusable area</span> in a
   <span>nested browsing context</span>. Let <var>starting point</var> be that
   <span>nested browsing context</span>'s <span>browsing context container</span>, and return to the
   step labeled <i>loop</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>sequential navigation search algorithm</dfn> consists of the following steps. This
  algorithm takes three arguments: <var>starting point</var>, <var>direction</var>,
  and <var>selection mechanism</var>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Pick the appropriate cell from the following table, and follow the instructions in that
    cell.</p>

    <p>The appropriate cell is the one that is from the column whose header describes <var>direction</var> and from the first row whose header describes <var>starting point</var> and <var>selection mechanism</var>.</p>

    <table>
     <thead>
      <tr>
       <th>
       <th> <var>direction</var> is <i>forward</i>
       <th> <var>direction</var> is <i>backward</i>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <th><var>starting point</var> is a <span>browsing context</span>
       <td>Let <var>candidate</var> be the first <span>suitable sequentially focusable area</span>
       in <var>starting point</var>'s <span>active document</span>, if any; or else null
       <td>Let <var>candidate</var> be the last <span>suitable sequentially focusable area</span>
       in <var>starting point</var>'s <span>active document</span>, if any; or else null
      <tr>
       <th><var>selection mechanism</var> is <i>DOM</i>
       <td>Let <var>candidate</var> be the first <span>suitable sequentially focusable area</span>
       in the <span>home document</span> following <var>starting point</var>, if any; or else null
       <td>Let <var>candidate</var> be the last <span>suitable sequentially focusable area</span>
       in the <span>home document</span> preceding <var>starting point</var>, if any; or else null
      <tr>
       <th><var>selection mechanism</var> is <i>sequential</i>

    </table>

    <p>A <dfn>suitable sequentially focusable area</dfn> is a <span>focusable area</span> whose
    <span>DOM anchor</span> is not <span>inert</span> and that is in its <code>Document</code>'s
    <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>.</p>

    <p>The <dfn>home document</dfn> is the <code>Document</code> to which <var>starting point</var>
    belongs.</p>

    <p>The <dfn>home sequential focus navigation order</dfn> is the <span>sequential focus
    navigation order</span> to which <var>starting point</var> belongs.</p>

    <p class="note">The <span>home sequential focus navigation order</span> is the <span>home
    document</span>'s <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>, but is only used when the
    <var>starting point</var> is in that <span>sequential focus navigation order</span>
    (when it's not, <var>selection mechanism</var> will be <i>DOM</i>).</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>candidate</var> is a <span>browsing context container</span> with a non-null
    <span>nested browsing context</span>, then let <var>new candidate</var> be the result of running
    the <span>sequential navigation search algorithm</span> with <var>candidate</var>'s <span>nested
    browsing context</span> as the first argument, <var>direction</var> as the second, and
    <i>sequential</i> <!-- shift-tab from the end in
    https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=2855 --> as the third.</p>

    <p>If <var>new candidate</var> is null, then let <var>starting point</var>
    be <var>candidate</var>, and return to the top of this algorithm. Otherwise, let
    <var>candidate</var> be <var>new candidate</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>candidate</var>.</p></li>
