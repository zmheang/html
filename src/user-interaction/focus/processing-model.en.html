   <li>

    <p>If <var>old focus target</var> is an <code>area</code> element and one of its shapes is the

    <p>Otherwise, if <var>old focus target</var> is a <span>focusable area</span>, then let <var>new
    focus target</var> be the first <span>focusable area</span> of its <span>control group</span>
    (if the <span>control group owner object</span> is a <code>Document</code>, this will always be
    a <span>viewport</span>).</p>

    <p>Otherwise, let <var>new focus target</var> be null.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>If <var>new focus target</var> is not null, then run the <span>focusing
   steps</span> for <var>new focus target</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span> is somehow
  unfocused without another element being explicitly focused in its stead, the user agent must
  <span>immediately</span> run the <span>unfocusing steps</span> for that object.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>unfocusing steps</span> do not always result in the focus changing, even
  when applied to the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span>. For
  example, if the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span> is a
  <span>viewport</span>, then it will usually keep its focus regardless until another
  <span>focusable area</span> is explicitly focused with the <span>focusing steps</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When a <span>focusable area</span> is added to an empty <span>control group</span>, it must be designated
  the <span>focused area of the control group</span>.</p>

  <p>When a <span>dialog group</span> is formed, if the <span>dialog group manager</span> has an empty
  <span>control group</span>, the first non-<span>inert</span> <code>dialog</code> in the <span>dialog
  group</span>, if any, or else the first <code>dialog</code> in the <span>dialog group</span> regardless of
  <span data-x="inert">inertness</span>, must be designated the <span>focused dialog of the dialog
  group</span>.</p>

  <p><dfn>Focus fixup rule one</dfn>: When the designated <span data-x="focused area of the control
  group">focused area of a control group</span> is removed from that <span>control group</span> in
  some way (e.g. it stops being a <span>focusable area</span>, it is removed from the DOM, it
  becomes <span>expressly inert</span>, etc), and the <span>control group</span> is still not
  empty: designate the first non-<span>inert</span> <span>focusable area</span> in that
  <span>control group</span> to be the new <span>focused area of the control group</span>, if any;
  if they are all <span>inert</span>, then designate the first <span>focusable area</span> in that
  <span>control group</span> to be the new <span>focused area of the control group</span> regardless
  of <span data-x="inert">inertness</span>. If such a removal instead results in the <span>control
  group</span> being empty, then there is simply no longer a <span>focused area of the control
  group</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, this might happen because an element is removed from its
  <code>Document</code>, or has a <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute added. It might
  also happen to an <code>input</code> element when the element gets <span
  data-x="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">In a <code>Document</code> without <code>dialog</code> elements, whose <span
  data-x="focused area of the control group">focused area</span> is a <code>button</code> element,
  removing, disabling, or hiding that button would cause the page's new <span data-x="focused area
  of the control group">focused area</span> to be the <span>viewport</span> of the
  <code>Document</code>. This would, in turn, be reflected through the <code
  data-x="dom-document-activeElement">activeElement</code> API as <span>the body
  element</span>.</p>

  <p><dfn>Focus fixup rule two</dfn>: When a <span>dialog group</span> has no designated <span>focused
  dialog of the dialog group</span>, and its <span>dialog group manager</span>'s <span>control
  group</span> changes from being non-empty to being empty, the first non-<span>inert</span>
  <code>dialog</code> in the <span>dialog group</span>, if any, or else the first <code>dialog</code> in
  the <span>dialog group</span> regardless of <span data-x="inert">inertness</span>, must be designated
  the <span>focused dialog of the dialog group</span>.</p>

  <p><dfn>Focus fixup rule three</dfn>: When the designated <span data-x="focused dialog of the
  dialog group">focused dialog of a dialog group</span> is removed from that <span>dialog
  group</span> in some way (e.g. it stops <span>being rendered</span>, it loses its <code
  data-x="attr-dialog-open">open</code> attribute, it becomes <span>expressly inert</span>, etc),
  and there is still a <span>dialog group</span> (because the <code>dialog</code> in question was
  not the last <code>dialog</code> in that <span>dialog group</span>): if the <span>dialog
  group</span>'s <span data-x="dialog group manager">manager</span>'s <span>control group</span> is
  non-empty, let there be no designated <span>focused dialog of the dialog group</span> any more;
  otherwise (in the case that the <span>control group</span> is empty), designate the first
  non-<span>inert</span> <code>dialog</code> in the <span>dialog group</span> to be the
  <span>focused dialog of the dialog group</span>, or, if they are all <span>inert</span>, designate
  the first <code>dialog</code> in the <span>dialog group</span> to be the <span>focused dialog of
  the dialog group</span> regardless of <span data-x="inert">inertness</span>.</p>

  <p>When the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span> was a <span>focusable
  area</span> but stops being a <span>focusable area</span>, or when it was a <code>dialog</code> in a
  <span>dialog group</span> and stops being part of that <span>dialog group</span>, or when it
  starts being <span>inert</span>, the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol> <!-- this is basically a special-cased version of the focusing steps -->

   <li><p>Let <var>old focus target</var> be whatever the <span data-x="currently focused
   area of a top-level browsing context">currently focused area of the top-level browsing
   context</span> was immediately before this algorithm became applicable (e.g. before the element
   was disabled, or the dialog was closed, or whatever caused this algorithm to run).</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>old chain</var> be the <span>focus chain</span> of the <span
   data-x="currently focused area of a top-level browsing context">currently focused area of the
   top-level browsing context</span> at the same time.</p></li>

   <li><p>Make sure that the changes implied by the focus fixup rules <span data-x="focus fixup rule
   one">one</span>, <span data-x="focus fixup rule two">two</span>, and <span data-x="focus fixup

   <li><p>Let <var>new focus target</var> be the <span>currently focused area of a
