  <h4>Data model</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>focusable area</dfn> is used to refer to regions of the interface that can become
  the target of keyboard input. Focusable areas can be elements, parts of elements, or other regions
  managed by the user agent.</p>

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> has a <dfn>DOM anchor</dfn>, which is a <code>Node</code> object
  that represents the position of the <span>focusable area</span> in the DOM. (When the <span>focusable
  area</span> is itself a <code>Node</code>, it is its own <span>DOM anchor</span>.) The <span>DOM anchor</span> is
  used in some APIs as a substitute for the <span>focusable area</span> when there is no other DOM object
  to represent the <span>focusable area</span>.</p>

  <p>The following table describes what objects can be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable
  areas</span>. The cells in the left column describe objects that can be <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span>; the cells in the right column describe the <span data-x="DOM anchor">DOM
  anchors</span> for those elements. (The cells that span both columns are non-normative examples.)</p>

  <p id="bc-focus-ergo-bcc-focus" class="note">A <span>browsing context container</span> (e.g. an
  <code>iframe</code>) is a <span>focusable area</span>, but key events routed to a <span>browsing context
  container</span> get immediately routed to the <span>nested browsing context</span>'s <span>active
  document</span>. Similarly, in sequential focus navigation a <span>browsing context
  container</span> essentially acts merely as a placeholder for its <span>nested browsing
  context</span>'s <span>active document</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The following create <dfn data-x="control group">control groups</dfn>:

  <ul class="brief">

   <li><code>Document</code> object that have <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing
   contexts</span>.</li>

   <li><code>dialog</code> elements that have an <code data-x="attr-dialog-open">open</code>
   attribute specified and that are <span>being rendered</span>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The corresponding <code>Document</code> object or <code>dialog</code> element is the created
  <span>control group</span>'s <dfn data-x="control group owner object">owner object</dfn>. (There
  is always a 1-to-1 mapping of <span data-x="control group">control groups</span> to <span
  data-x="control group owner object">control group owner objects</span>.)</p>

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> belongs to a single <span>control group</span> as follows. If
  the <span>DOM anchor</span> of a <span>focusable area</span> is a <span>control group
  owner object</span>, then that <span>focusable area</span> belongs to that <span>control group
  owner object</span>'s <span>control group</span>. Otherwise, the <span>focusable area</span>
  belongs to its <span>DOM anchor</span>'s nearest ancestor <span>control group owner
  object</span>'s <span>control group</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Thus:</p>

   <ul>
    <li><p>A <span>viewport</span> always belongs to the <span>control group</span> of the

    <li><p>An <code>input</code> control belongs to the <span>control group</span> of its nearest

   <p>In a page with no <code>dialog</code> elements, all elements that are <span>inert</span> are

   <p>Inside an <span>inert</span> <code>dialog</code> element, all descendant elements are not

  <p>One <span>focusable area</span> in each non-empty <span>control group</span> is designated the

  <p><span data-x="focusable area">Focusable areas</span> in <span data-x="control group">control groups</span>

  <p>The <dfn>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</dfn> at any particular time is
