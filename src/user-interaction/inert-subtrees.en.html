  <h3>Inert subtrees</h3>

  <p class="note">This section <strong>does not</strong> define or create any content attribute
  named "inert". This section merely defines an abstract <em>concept</em> of
  <span data-x="inert">inertness</span>.</p>

  <p>A node (in particular elements and text nodes) can be marked as <dfn>inert</dfn>. When a node
  is <span>inert</span>, then the user agent must act as if the node was absent for the purposes of
  targeting user interaction events, may ignore the node for the purposes of text search user
  interfaces (commonly known as "find in page"), and may prevent the user from selecting text in
  that node. User agents should allow the user to override the restrictions on search and text
  selection, however.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, consider a page that consists of just a single <span>inert</span>
  paragraph positioned in the middle of a <code>body</code>. If a user moves their pointing device
  from the <code>body</code> over to the <span>inert</span> paragraph and clicks on the paragraph,
  no <code data-x="event-mouseover">mouseover</code> event would be fired, and the <code
  data-x="event-mousemove">mousemove</code> and <code data-x="event-click">click</code> events would
  be fired on the <code>body</code> element rather than the paragraph.</p>

  <p class="note">When a node is inert, it generally cannot be focused. Inert nodes that are <span
  data-x="concept-command">commands</span> will also get disabled.</p>

  <p>While a <span>browsing context container</span> is marked as <span>inert</span>, its
  <span>nested browsing context</span>'s <span>active document</span>, and all nodes in that
  <code>Document</code>, must be marked as <span>inert</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <var>document</var> is <dfn>blocked by a modal dialog</dfn>
  <var>subject</var> if <var>subject</var> is the topmost <code>dialog</code> element in
  <var>document</var>'s <span>top layer</span>. While <var>document</var> is so blocked, every node
  that is <span>connected</span> to <var>document</var>, with the exception of the
  <var>subject</var> element and its <span data-x="shadow-including descendant">shadow-including
  descendants</span>, must be marked <span>inert</span>. (The elements excepted by this paragraph
  can additionally be marked <span>inert</span> through other means; being part of a modal dialog
  does not "protect" a node from being marked <span>inert</span>.)</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>dialog</code> element's <code
  data-x="dom-dialog-showModal">showModal()</code> method causes this mechanism to trigger, by <span
  data-x="top-layer-add">adding</span> the <code>dialog</code> element to its <span>node
  document</span>'s <span>top layer</span>.</p>
