  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>To enable Web applications to maintain bidirectional communications with server-side processes,
  this specification introduces the <code>WebSocket</code> interface.</p>

  <p class="note">This interface does not allow for raw access to the underlying network. For
  example, this interface could not be used to implement an IRC client without proxying messages
  through a custom server.</p>
