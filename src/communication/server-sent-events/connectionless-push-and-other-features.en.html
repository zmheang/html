  <h4 id="eventsource-push">Connectionless push and other features</h4>

  <p>User agents running in controlled environments, e.g. browsers on mobile handsets tied to
  specific carriers, may offload the management of the connection to a proxy on the network. In such
  a situation, the user agent for the purposes of conformance is considered to include both the
  handset software and the network proxy.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, a browser on a mobile device, after having established a connection, might detect
   that it is on a supporting network and request that a proxy server on the network take over the
   management of the connection. The timeline for such a situation might be as follows:</p>

   <ol>
    <li>Browser connects to a remote HTTP server and requests the resource specified by the author
    in the <code data-x="dom-EventSource">EventSource</code> constructor.</li>

    <li>The server sends occasional messages.</li>

    <li>In between two messages, the browser detects that it is idle except for the network activity
    involved in keeping the TCP connection alive, and decides to switch to sleep mode to save
    power.</li>

    <li>The browser disconnects from the server.</li>

    <li>The browser contacts a service on the network, and requests that the service, a "push
    proxy", maintain the connection instead.</li>

    <li>The "push proxy" service contacts the remote HTTP server and requests the resource specified
    by the author in the <code data-x="dom-EventSource">EventSource</code> constructor (possibly
    including a `<code data-x="http-last-event-id">Last-Event-ID</code>` HTTP header, etc).</li>

    <li>The browser allows the mobile device to go to sleep.</li>

    <li>The server sends another message.</li>

    <li>The "push proxy" service uses a technology such as OMA push to convey the event to the
    mobile device, which wakes only enough to process the event and then returns to sleep.</li>
   </ol>

  </div>

  <p>This can reduce the total data usage, and can therefore result in considerable power
  savings.</p>

  <p>As well as implementing the existing API and <code>text/event-stream</code> wire format as
  defined by this specification and in more distributed ways as described above, formats of event
  framing defined by <span>other applicable specifications</span> may be supported. This
  specification does not define how they are to be parsed or processed.</p>
