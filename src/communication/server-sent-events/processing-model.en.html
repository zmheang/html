  <p>The resource indicated in the argument to the <code data-x="dom-EventSource">EventSource</code>
  constructor is fetched when the constructor is run.</p>

  <p>As data is received, the <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> queued by the <span>networking
  task source</span> to handle the data must act as follows.</p>

  <p>HTTP 200 OK responses with a `<span>Content-Type</span>` header specifying the type
  `<code>text/event-stream</code>`, ignoring any <span>MIME type</span> parameters, must be
  processed line by line <a href="#event-stream-interpretation">as described below</a>.</p>

  <p>When a successful response with a supported <span>MIME type</span> is received, such that the
  user agent begins parsing the contents of the stream, the user agent must <span>announce the
  connection</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that the <span>networking task source</span> places
  on the <span>task queue</span> once fetching for such a resource (with the correct <span>MIME
  type</span>) has completed must cause the user agent to <span>reestablish the connection</span>
  <span>in parallel</span>. This applies whether the connection is closed gracefully or unexpectedly
  (but does not apply when fetching is canceled by the user agent, e.g., in response to <code
  data-x="dom-window-stop">window.stop()</code>, since in those cases the final <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span> is actually discarded). It doesn't apply for the error
  conditions listed below except where explicitly specified.</p>

  <p>HTTP 200 OK responses that have a <span>Content-Type</span> specifying an unsupported type, or
  that have no <span>Content-Type</span> at all, must cause the user agent to <span>fail the
  connection</span>.</p> <!-- about:blank is defined as having no MIME type -->

  <p id="event-source-network-errors-reconnect">Network errors that prevents the connection from
  being established in the first place (e.g. DNS errors), should cause the user agent to
  <span>reestablish the connection</span> <span>in parallel</span>, unless the user agent knows that
  to be futile, in which case the user agent may <span>fail the connection</span>.</p>

  <p id="event-source-fail-reasons">Any other HTTP response code not listed here, as well as the
  cancelation of the fetch algorithm by the user agent (e.g. in response to <code
  data-x="dom-window-stop">window.stop()</code> or the user canceling the network connection

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>announce the connection</dfn>, the user agent must <span>queue a
  task</span> which, if the <code data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is
  set to a value other than <code data-x="dom-EventSource-CLOSED">CLOSED</code>, sets the <code
  data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute to <code
  data-x="dom-EventSource-OPEN">OPEN</code> and <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fires an
  event</span> named <code data-x="event-open">open</code> at the <code>EventSource</code>
  object.</p>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>reestablish the connection</dfn>, the user agent must run the
  following steps. These steps are run <span>in parallel</span>, not as part of a <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span>. (The tasks that it queues, of course, are run like normal tasks
  and not themselves <span>in parallel</span>.)</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to run the following steps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the <code data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is set to
     <code data-x="dom-EventSource-CLOSED">CLOSED</code>, abort the task.</p></li>

     <li><p>Set the <code data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute to <code
     data-x="dom-EventSource-CONNECTING">CONNECTING</code>.</p></li>

     <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code
     data-x="event-error">error</code> at the <code>EventSource</code> object.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Wait a delay equal to the reconnection time of the event source.</li>

   <li><p>Optionally, wait some more. In particular, if the previous attempt failed, then user
   agents might introduce an exponential backoff delay to avoid overloading a potentially already
   overloaded server. Alternatively, if the operating system has reported that there is no network
   connectivity, user agents might wait for the operating system to announce that the network
   connection has returned before retrying.</li>

   <li><p>Wait until the aforementioned task has run, if it has not yet run.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to run the following steps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the <code>EventSource</code> object's <code
     data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is not set to <code
     data-x="dom-EventSource-CONNECTING">CONNECTING</code>, return.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>request</var> be the <code>EventSource</code> object's <span
     data-x="concept-event-stream-request">request</span>.

     <li><p>If the <code>EventSource</code> object's <span
     data-x="concept-event-stream-last-event-id">last event ID string</span> is not the empty
     string, <span data-x="concept-header-list-set">set</span> `<code

     <!--FETCH--><li><p><span data-x="concept-fetch">Fetch</span> <var>request</var> and process the
     response obtained in this fashion, if any, as described earlier in this section.</p></li>

  <p>When a user agent is to <dfn>fail the connection</dfn>, the user agent must <span>queue a
  task</span> which, if the <code data-x="dom-EventSource-readyState">readyState</code> attribute is
