  <h4>Implementation advice</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>User agents are strongly urged to provide detailed diagnostic information about
  <code>EventSource</code> objects and their related network connections in their development
  consoles, to aid authors in debugging code using this API.</p>

  <p>For example, a user agent could have a panel displaying all the <code>EventSource</code>
  objects a page has created, each listing the constructor's arguments, whether there was a network
  error, what the CORS status of the connection is and what headers were sent by the client and
  received from the server to lead to that status, the messages that were received and how they were
  parsed, and so forth.</p>

  <p>Implementations are especially encouraged to report detailed information to their development
  consoles whenever an <code data-x="event-error">error</code> event is fired, since little to no
  information can be made available in the events themselves.</p>
