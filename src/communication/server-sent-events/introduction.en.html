  <h4 id="server-sent-events-intro">Introduction</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>To enable servers to push data to Web pages over HTTP or using dedicated server-push protocols,
  this specification introduces the <code>EventSource</code> interface.</p>

  <p>Using this API consists of creating an <code>EventSource</code> object and registering an event
  listener.</p>

  <pre>var source = new EventSource('updates.cgi');
source.onmessage = function (event) {
  alert(event.data);
};</pre>

  <p>On the server-side, the script ("<code data-x="">updates.cgi</code>" in this case) sends
  messages in the following form, with the <code>text/event-stream</code> MIME type:</p>

  <pre>data: This is the first message.

data: This is the second message, it
data: has two lines.

data: This is the third message.</pre>

  <hr>

  <p>Authors can separate events by using different event types. Here is a stream that has two event
  types, "add" and "remove":</p>

  <pre>event: add
data: 73857293

event: remove
data: 2153

event: add
data: 113411</pre>

  <p>The script to handle such a stream would look like this (where <code data-x="">addHandler</code>
  and <code data-x="">removeHandler</code> are functions that take one argument, the event):</p>

  <pre>var source = new EventSource('updates.cgi');
source.addEventListener('add', addHandler, false);
source.addEventListener('remove', removeHandler, false);</pre>

  <p>The default event type is "message".</p>

  <p>Event streams are always decoded as UTF-8. There is no way to specify another character
  encoding.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Event stream requests can be redirected using HTTP 301 and 307 redirects as with normal HTTP
  requests. Clients will reconnect if the connection is closed; a client can be told to stop
  reconnecting using the HTTP 204 No Content response code.</p>

  <p>Using this API rather than emulating it using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or an
  <code>iframe</code> allows the user agent to make better use of network resources in cases where
  the user agent implementer and the network operator are able to coordinate in advance. Amongst
  other benefits, this can result in significant savings in battery life on portable devices. This
  is discussed further in the section below on <a href="#eventsource-push">connectionless
  push</a>.</p>
