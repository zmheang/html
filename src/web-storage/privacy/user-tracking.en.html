  <h4>User tracking</h4>

  <p>A third-party advertiser (or any entity capable of getting content distributed to multiple
  sites) could use a unique identifier stored in its local storage area to track a user across
  multiple sessions, building a profile of the user's interests to allow for highly targeted
  advertising. In conjunction with a site that is aware of the user's real identity (for example an
  e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could allow oppressive groups to
  target individuals with greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous web usage.</p>

  <p>There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of user tracking:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>User agents may restrict access to the <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code>
    objects to scripts originating at the domain of the <span>active document</span> of the <span>top-level browsing
    context</span>, for instance denying access to the API for pages from other domains running in
    <code>iframe</code>s.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>User agents may, possibly in a manner configured by the user, automatically delete stored
    data after a period of time.</p>

    <p>For example, a user agent could be configured to treat third-party local storage areas as
    session-only storage, deleting the data once the user had closed all the <span data-x="browsing
    context">browsing contexts</span> that could access it.</p>

    <p>This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the site would then only be able
    to track the user across multiple sessions when they authenticate with the site itself (e.g. by
    making a purchase or logging in to a service).</p>

    <p>However, this also reduces the usefulness of the API as a long-term storage mechanism. It can
    also put the user's data at risk, if the user does not fully understand the implications of data
    expiration.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>If users attempt to protect their privacy by clearing cookies without also clearing data
    stored in the local storage area, sites can defeat those attempts by using the two features as
    redundant backup for each other. User agents should present the interfaces for clearing these in
    a way that helps users to understand this possibility and enables them to delete data in all
    persistent storage features simultaneously. <ref spec=COOKIES></p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Site-specific safelisting of access to local storage areas</dt> <dd>
    <p>User agents may allow sites to access session storage areas in
    an unrestricted manner, but require the user to authorize access
    to local storage areas.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>User agents may record the <span data-x="origin">origins</span> of sites that contained
    content from third-party origins that caused data to be stored.</p>

    <p>If this information is then used to present the view of data currently in persistent storage,
    it would allow the user to make informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage
    to prune. Combined with a blocklist ("delete this data and prevent this domain from ever storing
    data again"), the user can restrict the use of persistent storage to sites that they trust.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Shared blocklists</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>User agents may allow users to share their persistent storage domain blocklists.</p>

    <p>This would allow communities to act together to protect their privacy.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user tracking, they do not block it
  altogether. Within a single domain, a site can continue to track the user during a session, and
  can then pass all this information to the third party along with any identifying information
  (names, credit card numbers, addresses) obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with
  multiple sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be created.</p>

  <p>However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no cooperation from the user agent
  whatsoever, for instance by using session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used
  for innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even retroactively). This
  information can then be shared with other sites, using visitors' IP addresses and other
  user-specific data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine separate
  sessions into coherent user profiles.</p>
