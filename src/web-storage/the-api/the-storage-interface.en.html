  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object provides access to a list of key/value pairs, which are
  sometimes called items. Keys are strings. Any string (including the empty string) is a valid key.
  Values are similarly strings.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Storage</code> object is associated with a list of key/value pairs when it is
  created, as defined in the sections on the <code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code>
  and <code data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attributes. Multiple separate objects
  implementing the <code>Storage</code> interface can all be associated with the same list of
  key/value pairs simultaneously.</p>

  <dl class="domintro">

   <dt><var>storage</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-Storage-length">length</code></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Returns the number of key/value pairs currently present in the list associated with the

   <dt><var>storage</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-Storage-key">key</code> ( <var>n</var> )</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Returns the name of the <var>n</var>th key in the list, or null if <var>n</var> is greater
    than or equal to the number of key/value pairs in the object.</p>
   <dd>

   <dt><var>value</var> = <var>storage</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-Storage-getItem">getItem</code> ( <var>key</var> )</dt>
   <dt><var>value</var> = <var>storage</var>[<var>key</var>]</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Returns the current value associated with the given <var>key</var>, or null if the given
    <var>key</var> does not exist in the list associated with the object.</p>

   <dt><var>storage</var>[<var>key</var>] = <var>value</var></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Sets the value of the pair identified by <var>key</var> to <var>value</var>, creating a new
    key/value pair if none existed for <var>key</var> previously.</p>

    <p>Throws a <span>"<code>QuotaExceededError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code> exception
    if the new value couldn't be set. (Setting could fail if, e.g., the user has disabled storage
    for the site, or if the quota has been exceeded.)</p>

   <dt><var>storage</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem</code> ( <var>key</var> )</dt>
   <dt><code>delete</code> <var>storage</var>[<var>key</var>]</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Removes the key/value pair with the given <var>key</var> from the list associated with the
    object, if a key/value pair with the given <var>key</var> exists.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><var>storage</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-Storage-clear">clear</code>()</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Empties the list associated with the object of all key/value pairs, if there are any.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-length">length</code></dfn> attribute must return the number
  of key/value pairs currently present in the list associated with the object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-key">key(<var>n</var>)</code></dfn> method must
  return the name of the <var>n</var>th key in the list. The order of keys is user-agent
  defined, but must be consistent within an object so long as the number of keys doesn't change.
  (Thus, <span data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">adding</span> or <span
  data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removing</span> a key may change the order of the keys, but merely
  changing the value of an existing key must not.) <!--The order of keys may differ between
  instances of the <code>Storage</code> interface accessing the same list. [removed for now for
  clarity, but if people ask, put it back. this is part of the spec.]--> If <var>n</var> is
  <!--less than zero or [can't, unsigned]--> greater than or equal to the number of key/value pairs
  in the object, then this method must return null.</p>

  <p>The <span>supported property names</span> on a <code>Storage</code> object are the keys of each
  key/value pair currently present in the list associated with the object, in the order that the
  keys were last added to the storage area.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-getItem">getItem(<var>key</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must return the current value associated with the given <var>key</var>. If the given <var>key</var> does not exist in the list associated with the object then this method must
  return null. </p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem(<var>key</var>, <var>value</var>)</code></dfn> method must first check if a key/value pair with the given <var>key</var> already exists in the list associated with the object.</p>

  <p>If it does not, then a new key/value pair must be added to the list, with the given <var>key</var> and with its value set to <var>value</var>.</p>

  <p>If the given <var>key</var> <em>does</em> exist in the list, and its value is not
  equal to <var>value</var>, then it must have its value updated to <var>value</var>. If its previous value <em>is</em> equal to <var>value</var>, then
  the method must do nothing.</p>

  <p>If it couldn't set the new value, the method must throw a
  <span>"<code>QuotaExceededError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code> exception.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem(<var>key</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must cause the key/value pair with the given <var>key</var> to be removed from the
  list associated with the object, if it exists. If no item with that key exists, the method must do
  nothing.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code> and <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code> methods must be atomic with respect to failure.
  In the case of failure, the method does nothing. That is, changes to the data storage area must
  either be successful, or the data storage area must not be changed at all.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code></dfn> method must atomically cause the
  list associated with the object to be emptied of all key/value pairs, if there are any. If there
  are none, then the method must do nothing.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">When the <code data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are invoked, events are fired on the
  <code>Window</code> objects of other <code>Document</code>s that can access the newly stored or
  removed data, as defined in the sections on the <code
  data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> and <code
  data-x="dom-localStorage">localStorage</code> attributes.</p> <!-- not normative, see the sections
  below for the normative statement -->

  <p class="note">This specification does not require that the above methods wait until the data has
  been physically written to disk. Only consistency in what different scripts accessing the same
  underlying list of key/value pairs see is required.</p>
