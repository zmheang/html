  <h4 id="scroll-to-fragid"><dfn data-x="navigate-fragid">Navigating to a fragment</dfn></h4>

  <p>When a user agent is supposed to navigate to a <span
  data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span>, optionally with <span>replacement enabled</span>,
  then the user agent must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>If not with <span>replacement enabled</span>, then remove all the entries in the
    <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session history</span> after the <span>current
    entry</span>. If the <span>current entry</span> is the last entry in the session history, then
    no entries are removed.</p>

    <p class="note">This <a href="#history-notes">doesn't necessarily have to affect</a> the user
    agent's user interface.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Remove any <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> queued by the <span>history traversal
   task source</span> that are associated with any <code>Document</code> objects in the
   <span>top-level browsing context</span>'s <span>document family</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Append a new entry at the end of the <code>History</code> object representing the new
   resource and its <code>Document</code> object, related state, and <span>current entry</span>'s
   <span>scroll restoration mode</span>. Its <span>URL</span> must be set to the address to which
   the user agent was <span data-x="navigate">navigating</span>. The title must be left
   unset.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Traverse the history</span> to the new entry, with <span>replacement enabled</span>
   if this was invoked with <span>replacement enabled</span>, and with the <i data-x="non-blocking
   events flag">non-blocking events flag</i> set. This will <span>scroll to the fragment</span>
   given in what is now the document's <span data-x="concept-document-url">URL</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">If the scrolling fails because the relevant <span data-x="concept-id">ID</span> has
  not yet been parsed, then the original <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span> algorithm will
  take care of the scrolling instead, as the last few steps of its <span>update the session history
  with the new page</span> algorithm.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn
  id="scroll-to-the-fragment-identifier">scroll to the fragment</dfn> and <span>the indicated part
  of the document</span>, if any, is <span>being rendered</span>, the user agent must either change
  the scrolling position of the document using the following algorithm, or perform some other action
  such that <span>the indicated part of the document</span> is brought to the user's attention. If
  there is no indicated part, or if the indicated part is not <span>being rendered</span>, then the
  user agent must do nothing. The aforementioned algorithm is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If there is no <span data-x="the indicated part of the document">indicated part of the
   document</span>, set the <code>Document</code>'s <span>target element</span> to null.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>If the <span data-x="the indicated part of the document">indicated part of the
    document</span> is the top of the document, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Set the <code>Document</code>'s <span>target element</span> to null.</p></li>

     <li><p><span>Scroll to the beginning of the document</span> for the <code>Document</code>. <ref
     spec=CSSOMVIEW></p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Otherwise:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>target</var> be element that is <span>the indicated part of the
     document</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Set the <code>Document</code>'s <span>target element</span> to
     <var>target</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p><span data-x="scroll an element into view">Scroll <var>target</var> into view</span>,
     with <var>behavior</var> set to "auto", <var>block</var> set to "start", and <var>inline</var>
     set to "nearest". <ref spec=CSSOMVIEW></p></li>

     <li><p>Run the <span>focusing steps</span> for <var>target</var>, with the
     <code>Document</code>'s <span>viewport</span> as the <i>fallback target</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Move the <span>sequential focus navigation starting point</span> to
     <var>target</var>.</p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p><dfn>The indicated part of the document</dfn> is the one that the <span
  data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span>, if any, identifies. The semantics of the <span
  data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span> in terms of mapping it to a node is defined by the
  specification that defines the <span>MIME type</span> used by the <code>Document</code> (for
  example, the processing of <span data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragments</span> for <span
  data-x="XML MIME type">XML MIME types</span> is the responsibility of RFC7303). <ref
  spec=RFC7303></p>

  <p>There is also a <dfn>target element</dfn> for each <code>Document</code>, which is used in
  defining the <code data-x="selector-target">:target</code> pseudo-class and is updated by the
  above algorithm. It is initially null.</p>

  <p>For HTML documents (and <span data-x="HTML MIME type">HTML MIME types</span>), the following
  processing model must be followed to determine what <span>the indicated part of the
  document</span> is.</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>fragment</var> be the document's <span data-x="concept-document-url">URL</span>'s
   <span data-x="concept-url-fragment">fragment</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>fragment</var> is the empty string, then <span>the indicated part of the
   document</span> is the top of the document; return.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <span>find a potential indicated element</span> with <var>fragment</var> returns
   non-null, then the return value is <span>the indicated part of the document</span>;
   return.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>fragmentBytes</var> be the result of <span data-x="string percent decode">string
   percent decoding</span> <var>fragment</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>decodedFragment</var> be the result of running <span>UTF-8 decode without
   BOM</span> on <var>fragmentBytes</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <span>find a potential indicated element</span> with <var>decodedFragment</var> returns
   non-null, then the return value is <span>the indicated part of the document</span>;
   return.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>decodedFragment</var> is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the
   string <code data-x="">top</code>, then <span>the indicated part of the document</span> is the
   top of the document; return.</p></li>

   <li><p>There is no <span data-x="the indicated part of the document">indicated part of the
   document</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>To <dfn>find a potential indicated element</dfn> given a string <var>fragment</var>, run these
  steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If there is an element <span data-x="in a document tree">in the document tree</span> that
   has an <span data-x="concept-id">ID</span> equal to <var>fragment</var>, then return the first
   such element in <span>tree order</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If there is an <code>a</code> element <span data-x="in a document tree">in the document
   tree</span> that has a <code data-x="attr-a-name">name</code> attribute whose value is equal to
   <var>fragment</var>, then return the first such element in <span>tree order</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return null.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <span>task source</span> for the task mentioned in this section must be the <span>DOM
  manipulation task source</span>.</p>
