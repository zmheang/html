  <h3>The <code>WindowProxy</code> exotic object</h3>

  <p>A <dfn data-export="" data-dfn-type="interface"><code>WindowProxy</code></dfn> is an exotic
  object that wraps a <code>Window</code> ordinary object, indirecting most operations through to
  the wrapped object. Each <span>browsing context</span> has an associated <code>WindowProxy</code>
  object. When the <span>browsing context</span> is <span data-x="navigate">navigated</span>, the
  <code>Window</code> object wrapped by the <span>browsing context</span>'s associated
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object is changed.</p>

  <p>There is no <code>WindowProxy</code> <span>interface object</span>.</p>

  <p>Every <code>WindowProxy</code> object has a
  <dfn data-x="concept-windowproxy-window">[[Window]]</dfn> internal slot representing the wrapped
  <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <code>WindowProxy</code> object internal methods are described in the subsections
  below.</p>

  <p class="note">Although <code>WindowProxy</code> is named as a "proxy", it does not do
  polymorphic dispatch on its target's internal methods as a real proxy would, due to a desire to
  reuse machinery between <code>WindowProxy</code> and <code>Location</code> objects. As long as the
  <code>Window</code> object remains an ordinary object this is unobservable and can be implemented
  either way.</p>
