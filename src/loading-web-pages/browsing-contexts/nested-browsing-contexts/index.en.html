  <h4>Nested browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>Certain elements (for example, <code>iframe</code> elements) can instantiate further <span
  data-x="browsing context">browsing contexts</span>. These elements are called <dfn
  data-x="browsing context container" data-export="" data-lt="browsing context container">browsing
  context containers</dfn>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>browsing context container</span> has a <dfn data-export="">nested browsing
  context</dfn>, which is either a <span>browsing context</span> or null.</p>

  <p>If a <span>browsing context</span> is the <span>nested browsing context</span> of a
  <span>browsing context container</span>, then the browsing context is said to be <dfn
  data-x="browsing context nested through" data-export="">nested through</dfn> the <span>browsing
  context container</span>'s <span>node document</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> <var>child</var> is said to be a <dfn data-export="">child
  browsing context</dfn> of another <span>browsing context</span> <var>parent</var>, if all of the
  following conditions hold:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p><var>child</var> is a <span>nested browsing context</span> of a <span>browsing context
   container</span> <var>element</var></p></li>

   <li><p><var>element</var> is <span>connected</span></p></li>

   <li><p><var>element</var>'s <span>shadow-including root</span>'s <span
   data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> is <var>parent</var></p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> <var>child</var> is then a <dfn>document-tree child browsing
  context</dfn> of <var>parent</var> if it is a <span>child browsing context</span> and its
  <span>browsing context container</span> is not just <span>connected</span>, but also <span>in a
  document tree</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> <var>child</var> may have a <dfn data-export="">parent browsing
  context</dfn>. This is the unique <span>browsing context</span> that has <var>child</var> as a
  <span>child browsing context</span>, if any such browsing context exists. Otherwise, the
  <span>browsing context</span> has no <span>parent browsing context</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> <var>A</var> is said to be an <dfn data-x="ancestor browsing
  context" data-export="" data-lt="ancestor browsing context">ancestor</dfn> of a browsing context
  <var>B</var> if there exists a browsing context <var>A'</var> that is a <span>child browsing
  context</span> of <var>A</var> and that is itself an <span data-x="ancestor browsing
  context">ancestor</span> of <var>B</var>, or if the browsing context <var>A</var> is the
  <span>parent browsing context</span> of <var>B</var>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> that is not a <span>nested browsing context</span> has no
  <span>parent browsing context</span>, and is the <dfn data-export="">top-level browsing
  context</dfn> of all the browsing contexts for which it is an <span>ancestor browsing
  context</span>.</p>

  <p>The transitive closure of <span data-x="parent browsing context">parent browsing contexts</span>
  for a <span>browsing context</span> that is a <span>nested browsing context</span> gives the list
  of <span data-x="ancestor browsing context">ancestor browsing contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>list of the descendant browsing contexts</dfn> of a <code>Document</code> <var>d</var>
  is the (ordered) list returned by the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>list</var> be an empty list.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>For each <span>child browsing context</span> of <var>d</var> that is <span data-x="browsing
    context nested through">nested through</span> an element that is <span data-x="in a document">in
    the <code>Document</code></span> <var>d</var>, in the <span>tree order</span> of the elements
    nesting those <span data-x="browsing context">browsing contexts</span>, run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Append that <span>child browsing context</span> to the list <var>list</var>.</p>

     <li><p>Append the <span>list of the descendant browsing contexts</span> of the <span>active
     document</span> of that <span>child browsing context</span> to the list <var>list</var>.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return the constructed <var>list</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> is said to be <dfn data-export="" data-dfn-for="Document">fully
  active</dfn> when it has a <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> and it is
  the <span>active document</span> of that <span>browsing context</span>, and either its browsing
  context is a <span>top-level browsing context</span>, or it has a <span>parent browsing
  context</span> and the <code>Document</code> <span data-x="browsing context nested
  through">through which</span> it is <span data-x="nested browsing context">nested</span> is itself
  <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>Because they are associated with an element, <span data-x="child browsing context">child
  browsing contexts</span> are always tied to a specific <code>Document</code> in their <span>parent
  browsing context</span>. User agents must not allow the user to interact with <span data-x="child
  browsing context">child browsing contexts</span> of elements that are in <code>Document</code>s
  that are not themselves <span>fully active</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> that is a <span>nested browsing context</span> can be put into
  a <dfn>delaying <code data-x="event-load">load</code> events mode</dfn>. This is used when it is
  <span data-x="navigate">navigated</span>, to <span>delay the load event</span> of its
  <span>browsing context container</span> before the new <code>Document</code> is created.</p>

<!--(There's no current way for this to happen, since removing an iframe from a document discards its browsing context)
  <p class="note">A <span>nested browsing context</span> can in some cases be taken out of its
  <span>parent browsing context</span> (e.g. if an <code>iframe</code> element is removed from its
  <code>Document</code>). In such a situation, the <span>nested browsing context</span> has no
  <span>parent browsing context</span>, but it still has the same <span>browsing context
  container</span> and is still <span data-x="browsing context nested through">nested through</span>
  that element's <span>node document</span>. Such a <span>nested browsing context</span> is <em>not</em>
  a <span>top-level browsing context</span>, and cannot contain <code>Document</code>s that are
  <span>fully active</span>. Furthermore, if a <span>browsing context container</span> (such as an
  <code>iframe</code>) is moved to another <code>Document</code>, then the <span>parent browsing
  context</span> of its <span>nested browsing context</span> will change.</p>
-->

  <p>The <dfn>document family</dfn> of a <span>browsing context</span> consists of the union of all
  the <code>Document</code> objects in that <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session
  history</span> and the <span data-x="document family">document families</span> of all those
  <code>Document</code> objects. The <span>document family</span> of a <code>Document</code> object
  consists of the union of all the <span data-x="document family">document families</span> of the
  <span data-x="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> that are <span data-x="browsing context
  nested through">nested through</span> the <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="concept-bcc-content-document">content document</dfn> of a <span>browsing
  context container</span> <var>container</var> is the result of the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>container</var>'s <span>nested browsing context</span> is null, then return
   null.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>context</var> be <var>container</var>'s <span>nested browsing
   context</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>document</var> be <var>context</var>'s <span>active document</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>document</var>'s <span>origin</span> and the <span
   data-x="concept-settings-object-origin">origin</span> specified by the <span>current settings
   object</span> are not <span>same origin-domain</span>, then return null.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var>document</var>.</p></li>
