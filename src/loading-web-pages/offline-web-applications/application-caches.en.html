  <h4 id="appcache">Application caches</h4> <!--APPCACHE-->

  <p>An <dfn export>application cache</dfn> is a set of cached resources consisting of:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>
    <p>One or more resources (including their out-of-band metadata, such as HTTP headers, if any),
    identified by URLs, each falling into one (or more) of the following categories:</p>

    <dl>
     <dt><dfn data-x="concept-appcache-primary">Primary entries</dfn>

     <dd><p class="note">These are documents that were added to the cache because a <span>browsing
     context</span> was <span data-x="navigate">navigated</span> to that document and the document
     indicated that this was its cache, using the <code data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code>
     attribute.</p>


     <dt><dfn data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">The manifest</dfn>

     <dd><p class="note">This is the resource corresponding to the URL that was given in a primary
     entry's <code>html</code> element's <code data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute.
     The manifest is fetched and processed during the <span>application cache download
     process</span>. All the <span data-x="concept-appcache-primary">primary entries</span> have the
     <span data-x="same origin">same origin</span> as the manifest.</p>


     <dt><dfn data-x="concept-appcache-explicit">Explicit entries</dfn>

     <dd><p class="note">These are the resources that were listed in the cache's <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> in an <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-explicit">explicit section</span>.</p>


     <dt><dfn data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">Fallback entries</dfn>

     <dd><p class="note">These are the resources that were listed in the cache's <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> in a <span
     data-x="concept-appcache-manifest-fallback">fallback section</span>.</p>

    </dl>

    <p><span data-x="concept-appcache-explicit">Explicit entries</span> and <span
    data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">Fallback entries</span> can be marked as <dfn
    data-x="concept-appcache-foreign">foreign</dfn>, which means that they have a <code
    data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute but that it doesn't point at this cache's
    <span data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">A URL in the list can be flagged with multiple different types, and thus an
    entry can end up being categorized as multiple entries. For example, an entry can be a manifest
    entry and an explicit entry at the same time, if the manifest is listed within the manifest.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Zero or more <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback namespaces</dfn>, each of
    which is mapped to a <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entry</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">These are URLs used as <span data-x="concept-appcache-matches-fallback">prefix
    match patterns</span> for resources that are to be fetched from the network if possible, or to
    be replaced by the corresponding <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback">fallback entry</span>
    if not. Each namespace URL has the <span>same origin</span> as <span
    data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">the manifest</span>.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Zero or more URLs that form the <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online
    safelist namespaces</dfn>.</p>

    <p class="note">These are used as prefix match patterns, and declare URLs for which the user
    agent will ignore the application cache, instead fetching them normally (i.e. from the network
    or local HTTP cache as appropriate).</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>An <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist-wildcard">online safelist wildcard
    flag</dfn>, which is either <i>open</i> or <i>blocking</i>.</p>

    <p class="note">The <i>open</i> state indicates that any URL not listed as cached is to
    be implicitly treated as being in the <span data-x="concept-appcache-onlinesafelist">online
    safelist namespaces</span>; the <i>blocking</i> state indicates that URLs not listed
    explicitly in the manifest are to be treated as unavailable.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>A <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-mode">cache mode flag</dfn>, which is either in the <dfn
    data-x="concept-appcache-mode-fast"><i>fast</i></dfn> state or the <dfn
    data-x="concept-appcache-mode-prefer-online"><i>prefer-online</i></dfn> state.</p>
   </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Each <span>application cache</span> has a <dfn
  data-x="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness flag</dfn>, which is either <i>complete</i> or
  <i>incomplete</i>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>An <dfn>application cache group</dfn> is a group of <span data-x="application cache">application
  caches</span>, identified by the <span>absolute URL</span> of a resource <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span> which is used to populate the caches in the
  group.</p>

  <p>An <span>application cache</span> is <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-newer">newer</dfn> than
  another if it was created after the other (in other words, <span data-x="application
  cache">application caches</span> in an <span>application cache group</span> have a chronological
  order).</p>

  <p>Only the newest <span>application cache</span> in an <span>application cache group</span> can
  have its <span data-x="concept-appcache-completeness">completeness flag</span> set to
  <i>incomplete</i>; the others are always all <i>complete</i>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>application cache group</span> has an <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-status">update
  status</dfn>, which is one of the following: <i>idle</i>, <i>checking</i>, <i>downloading</i>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>relevant application cache</dfn> is an <span>application cache</span> that is the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-newer">newest</span> in its <span data-x="application cache
  group">group</span> to be <i>complete</i>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>application cache group</span> has a <dfn
  data-x="concept-appcache-pending-primary-entries">list of pending primary entries</dfn>. Each entry in this
  list consists of a resource and a corresponding <code>Document</code> object. It is used during
  the <span>application cache download process</span> to ensure that new primary entries are cached
  even if the <span>application cache download process</span> was already running for their
  <span>application cache group</span> when they were loaded.</p>

  <p>An <span>application cache group</span> can be marked as <dfn
  data-x="concept-appcache-obsolete">obsolete</dfn>, meaning that it must be ignored when looking at
  what <span data-x="application cache group">application cache groups</span> exist.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>A <dfn>cache host</dfn> is a <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p>Each <span>cache host</span> has an associated <code>ApplicationCache</code> object.</p>

  <p>Each <span>cache host</span> initially is not associated with an <span>application
  cache</span>, but can become associated with one early during the page load process, when steps <a
  href="#parser-appcache">in the parser</a> and in the <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span>
  sections cause <span data-x="concept-appcache-init">cache selection</span> to occur.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Multiple <span data-x="application cache">application caches</span> in different <span
  data-x="application cache group">application cache groups</span> can contain the same resource,
  e.g. if the manifests all reference that resource. If the user agent is to <dfn
  data-x="concept-appcache-selection">select an application cache</dfn> from a list of <span
  data-x="relevant application cache">relevant application caches</span> that contain a resource, the
  user agent must use the application cache that the user most likely wants to see the resource
  from, taking into account the following:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>which application cache was most recently updated,

   <li>which application cache was being used to display the resource from which the user decided to
   look at the new resource, and

   <li>which application cache the user prefers.

  </ul>

  <hr>

  <p>A URL <dfn data-x="concept-appcache-matches-fallback">matches a fallback namespace</dfn> if
  there exists a <span>relevant application cache</span> whose <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">manifest</span>'s URL has the <span>same origin</span> as the
  URL in question, and that has a <span data-x="concept-appcache-fallback-ns">fallback
  namespace</span> that is a <span>prefix match</span> for the URL being examined. If multiple
  fallback namespaces match the same URL, the longest one is the one that matches. A URL looking for
  a fallback namespace can match more than one application cache at a time, but only matches one
  namespace in each cache.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a manifest <code data-x="">https://example.com/app1/manifest</code> declares that <code
   data-x="">https://example.com/resources/images</code> is a fallback namespace, and the user
   navigates to <code data-x="">https://example.com:80/resources/images/cat.png</code>, then the user
   agent will decide that the application cache identified by <code
   data-x="">https://example.com/app1/manifest</code> contains a namespace with a match for that
   URL.</p>

   <!-- "parse a url" canonicalises the case for the scheme and host and removes the port if it is
   the default -->
