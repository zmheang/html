  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>In order to enable users to continue interacting with web applications and documents even when
  their network connection is unavailable &mdash; for instance, because they are traveling outside
  of their ISP's coverage area &mdash; authors can provide a manifest which lists the files that are
  needed for the web application to work offline and which causes the user's browser to keep a copy
  of the files for use offline.</p>

  <p>To illustrate this, consider a simple clock applet consisting of an HTML page "<code
  data-x="">clock1.html</code>", a CSS style sheet "<code data-x="">clock.css</code>", and a
  JavaScript script "<code data-x="">clock.js</code>".</p>

  <p>Before adding the manifest, these three files might look like this:</p>

  <pre><code class="html">EXAMPLE offline/clock/clock1.html</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="css">EXAMPLE offline/clock/clock.css</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="js">EXAMPLE offline/clock/clock.js</code></pre>

  <p>If the user tries to open the "<code data-x="">clock1.html</code>" page while offline, though,
  the user agent (unless it happens to have it still in the local cache) will fail with an
  error.</p>

  <p>The author can instead provide a manifest of the three files, say "<code
  data-x="">clock.appcache</code>":</p>

  <pre>EXAMPLE offline/clock/clock.appcache</pre>

  <p>With a small change to the HTML file, the manifest (served as <code>text/cache-manifest</code>)
  is linked to the application:</p>

  <pre><code class="html">EXAMPLE offline/clock/clock2.html</code></pre>

  <p>Now, if the user goes to the page, the browser will cache the files and make them available
  even when the user is offline.</p>

  <p class="note">Authors are encouraged to include the main page in the manifest also, but in
  practice the page that referenced the manifest is automatically cached even if it isn't explicitly
  mentioned.</p>

  <p class="note">With the exception of "no-store" directive, HTTP cache headers and restrictions on
  caching pages served over TLS (encrypted, using <code data-x="https protocol">https:</code>) are
  overridden by manifests. Thus, pages will not expire from an application cache before the user
  agent has updated it, and even applications served over TLS can be made to work offline.</p>
