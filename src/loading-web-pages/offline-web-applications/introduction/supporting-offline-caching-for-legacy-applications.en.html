  <h5>Supporting offline caching for legacy applications</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>The application cache feature works best if the application logic is separate from the
  application and user data, with the logic (markup, scripts, style sheets, images, etc) listed in
  the manifest and stored in the application cache, with a finite number of static HTML pages for
  the application, and with the application and user data stored in Web Storage or a client-side
  Indexed Database, updated dynamically using Web Sockets, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, server-sent
  events, or some other similar mechanism.</p>

  <p>This model results in a fast experience for the user: the application immediately loads, and
  fresh data is obtained as fast as the network will allow it (possibly while stale data shows).</p>

  <p>Legacy applications, however, tend to be designed so that the user data and the logic are mixed
  together in the HTML, with each operation resulting in a new HTML page from the server.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, consider a news application. The typical architecture of such an application,
   when not using the application cache feature, is that the user fetches the main page, and the
   server returns a dynamically-generated page with the current headlines and the user interface
   logic mixed together.</p>

   <p>A news application designed for the application cache feature, however, would instead have the
   main page just consist of the logic, and would then have the main page fetch the data separately
   from the server, e.g. using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The mixed-content model does not work well with the application cache feature: since the
  content is cached, it would result in the user always seeing the stale data from the previous time
  the cache was updated.</p>

  <p>While there is no way to make the legacy model work as fast as the separated model, it
  <em>can</em> at least be retrofitted for offline use using the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-mode-prefer-online">prefer-online</span> <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-mode">application cache mode</span>. To do so, list all the static
  resources used by the HTML page you want to have work offline in an <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-manifest">application cache manifest</span>, use the <code
  data-x="attr-html-manifest">manifest</code> attribute to select that manifest from the HTML file,
  and then add the following line at the bottom of the manifest:</p>

  <pre>SETTINGS:
prefer-online
NETWORK:
*</pre>

  <p>This causes the <span>application cache</span> to only be used for <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-primary">primary entries</span> when the user is offline, and causes the
  application cache to be used as an atomic HTTP cache (essentially pinning resources listed in the
  manifest), while allowing all resources not listed in the manifest to be accessed normally when
  the user is online.</p>
