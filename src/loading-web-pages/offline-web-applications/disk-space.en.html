  <h4>Disk space</h4>

  <p>User agents should consider applying constraints on disk usage of <span data-x="application
  cache">application caches</span>, and care should be taken to ensure that the restrictions cannot
  be easily worked around using subdomains.</p>

  <p>User agents should allow users to see how much space each domain is using, and may offer the
  user the ability to delete specific <span data-x="application cache">application caches</span>.</p>

  <p>For predictability, quotas should be based on the uncompressed size of data stored.</p>
  <!-- see https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=21319#c3 -->

  <p class="note">How quotas are presented to the user is not defined by this specification. User
  agents are encouraged to provide features such as allowing a user to indicate that certain sites
  are trusted to use more than the default quota, e.g. by presenting a non-modal user interface
  while a cache is being updated, or by having an explicit safelist in the user agent's
  configuration interface.</p>
