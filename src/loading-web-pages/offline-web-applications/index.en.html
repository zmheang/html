  <!-- v2 ideas for appcache:

     * A way to limit what gets download when the user agent is updating the application cache and
       it turns out the server has changed EVERY page because every page has a dynamic "site last
       modified" date on it.

       https://groups.google.com/group/gears-users/browse_thread/thread/efbd808325df607a/c73adb34f9b63cf7?hl=en&q=whatwg#c73adb34f9b63cf7


     * Multiuser appcaches.

       If the application code (HTML, JS, CSS) is all the same for two users, then appcache works
       for multiple users by just having the data for the users separate from the logic.

       This is the expected model for most apps. For example, your typical blog has just one set of
       CSS for all users.

       For systems where the user affects what HTML, JS, and CSS is served back, the spec as written
       pretty much requires that there be one app per user, and one generic "login" app that then
       redirects to one of those other apps - and where each app has a different base URL, separate
       manifest, etc.

       An alternative that we could explore in a future version is to have the manifest include a
       manifest name, and then have script that allows you to "activate" a particular manifest name
       for a given appcache.

       So each appcache group would be further subdivided into named subgroups, and for a given
       manifest URL with such a group of subgroups, one subgroup would be the default one at a time.
       The inactive ones would just lie dormant, but and the active ones would act like now, but
       there'd be a scripted way to change the default (and maybe query what available variants
       exist for the current appcache), so that you could log back in as someone else by just making
       the script pick the other user's variant, and then reloading.


     * Add and remove specific additional files from the cache (e.g. precaching new primary entries).
