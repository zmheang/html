   <dt><cite>Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals</cite> <ref spec=CHARMOD></dt>

   <dd><blockquote><p>This Architectural Specification provides authors of specifications, software
   developers, and content developers with a common reference for interoperable text manipulation on
   the World Wide Web, building on the Universal Character Set, defined jointly by the Unicode
   Standard and ISO/IEC 10646. Topics addressed include use of the terms 'character', 'encoding' and
   'string', a reference processing model, choice and identification of character encodings,
   character escaping, and string indexing.</p></blockquote></dd>

   <dt><cite>Unicode Security Considerations</cite> <ref spec=UTR36></dt>

   <dd><blockquote><p>Because Unicode contains such a large number of characters and incorporates
   the varied writing systems of the world, incorrect usage can expose programs or systems to
   possible security attacks. This is especially important as more and more products are
   internationalized. This document describes some of the security considerations that programmers,
   system analysts, standards developers, and users should take into account, and provides specific
   recommendations to reduce the risk of problems.</p></blockquote></dd>

   <dt><cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</cite> <ref spec=WCAG></dt>

   <dd><blockquote><p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of
   recommendations for making web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make
   content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low
   vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited
   movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these
   guidelines will also often make your web content more usable to users in
   general.</p></blockquote></dd>

   <dt w-nodev><cite>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</cite> <ref spec=ATAG></dt>

   <dd w-nodev><blockquote><p>This specification provides guidelines for designing web content
   authoring tools that are more accessible for people with disabilities. An authoring tool that
   conforms to these guidelines will promote accessibility by providing an accessible user interface
   to authors with disabilities as well as by enabling, supporting, and promoting the production of
   accessible web content by all authors.</p></blockquote></dd>

   <dt w-nodev><cite>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</cite> <ref spec=UAAG></dt>

   <dd w-nodev><blockquote><p>This document provides guidelines for designing user agents that
   lower barriers to web accessibility for people with disabilities. User agents include browsers
   and other types of software that retrieve and render web content. A user agent that conforms to
   these guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user interface and through other
   internal facilities, including its ability to communicate with other technologies (especially
   assistive technologies). Furthermore, all users, not just users with disabilities, should find
   conforming user agents to be more usable.</p></blockquote></dd>
