  <h3 id="is-this-html5?">Is this HTML5?</h3>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>In short: Yes.</p>

  <p>In more length: the term "HTML5" is widely used as a buzzword to refer to modern Web
  technologies, many of which (though by no means all) are developed at the WHATWG. This document is
  one such; others are available from <a href="https://whatwg.org/specs/">the WHATWG
  specification index</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Although we have asked them to stop doing so, the W3C also republishes some parts
  of this specification as separate documents.</p>
