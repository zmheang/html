  <h4>Overview</h4>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Sometimes, it is desirable to annotate content with specific machine-readable labels, e.g. to
  allow generic scripts to provide services that are customized to the page, or to enable content
  from a variety of cooperating authors to be processed by a single script in a consistent
  manner.</p>

  <p>For this purpose, authors can use the microdata features described in this section. Microdata
  allows nested groups of name-value pairs to be added to documents, in parallel with the existing
  content.</p>
