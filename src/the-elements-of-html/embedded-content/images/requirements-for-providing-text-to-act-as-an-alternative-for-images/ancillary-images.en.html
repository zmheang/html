  <h6>Ancillary images</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image is not critical to the content, but is nonetheless neither purely
  decorative nor entirely redundant with the text. In these cases, the <code
  data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present, and its value should either be the
  empty string, or a textual representation of the information that the image conveys. If the image
  has a caption giving the image's title, then the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute's value must not be empty (as that would be quite confusing for non-visual readers).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider a news article about a political figure, in which the individual's face was shown in
   an image that, through a style sheet, is floated to the right. The image is not purely
   decorative, as it is relevant to the story. The image is not entirely redundant with the story
   either, as it shows what the politician looks like. Whether any alternative text need be provided
   is an authoring decision, in part influenced by whether the image colors the interpretation of
   the prose.</p>

   <p>In this first variant, the image is shown without context, and no alternative text is
   provided:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="alexsalmond.jpeg" alt=""></strong> Ahead of today's referendum,
the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, wrote an open letter to all
registered voters. In it, he admitted that all countries make mistakes.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>If the picture is just a face, there might be no value in describing it. It's of no interest
   to the reader whether the individual has red hair or blond hair, whether the individual has white
   skin or black skin, whether the individual has one eye or two eyes.</p>

   <p>However, if the picture is more dynamic, for instance showing the politician as angry, or
   particularly happy, or devastated, some alternative text would be useful in setting the tone of
   the article, a tone that might otherwise be missed:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="alexsalmond.jpeg" alt="Alex Salmond is sad."></strong>
Ahead of today's referendum, the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond,
wrote an open letter to all registered voters. In it, he admitted that all
countries make mistakes.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="alexsalmond.jpeg" alt="Alex Salmond is ecstatic!"></strong>
Ahead of today's referendum, the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond,
wrote an open letter to all registered voters. In it, he admitted that all
countries make mistakes.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>Whether the individual was "sad" or "ecstatic" makes a difference to how the rest of the
   paragraph is to be interpreted: is he likely saying that he is resigned to the populace making a
   bad choice in the upcoming referendum, or is he saying that the election was a mistake but the
   likely turnout will make it irrelevant? The interpretation varies based on the image.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If the image has a caption, then including alternative text avoids leaving the non-visual user
   confused as to what the caption refers to.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p>Ahead of today's referendum, the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond,
wrote an open letter to all registered voters. In it, he admitted that all
countries make mistakes.&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;figure>
 &lt;img src="alexsalmond.jpeg"
      alt="A high forehead, cheerful disposition, and dark hair round out Alex Salmond's face.">
