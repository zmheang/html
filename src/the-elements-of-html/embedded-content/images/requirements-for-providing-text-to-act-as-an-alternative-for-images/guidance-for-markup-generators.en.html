  <h6>Guidance for markup generators</h6>

  <p>Markup generators (such as WYSIWYG authoring tools) should, wherever possible, obtain
  alternative text from their users. However, it is recognized that in many cases, this will not be
  possible.</p>

  <p>For images that are the sole contents of links, markup generators should examine the link
  target to determine the title of the target, or the URL of the target, and use information
  obtained in this manner as the alternative text.</p>

  <p>For images that have captions, markup generators should use the <code>figure</code> and
  <code>figcaption</code> elements, or the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute, to
  provide the image's caption.</p>

  <p>As a last resort, implementers should either set the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute to the empty string, under the assumption that the image is a purely decorative image
  that doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding content, or omit the
  <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute altogether, under the assumption that the image is
  a key part of the content.</p>

  <p>Markup generators may specify a <dfn><code data-x="attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code></dfn>
  attribute on <code>img</code> elements for which they have been unable to obtain alternative text
  and for which they have therefore omitted the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute. The
  value of this attribute must be the empty string. Documents containing such attributes are not
  conforming, but conformance checkers will <a href="#guidance-for-conformance-checkers">silently
  ignore</a> this error.</p>

  <p class="note">This is intended to avoid markup generators from being pressured into replacing
  the error of omitting the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute with the even more
  egregious error of providing phony alternative text, because state-of-the-art automated
  conformance checkers cannot distinguish phony alternative text from correct alternative text.</p>

  <p>Markup generators should generally avoid using the image's own file name as the alternative
  text. Similarly, markup generators should avoid generating alternative text from any content that
  will be equally available to presentation user agents (e.g. Web browsers).</p>

  <p class="note">This is because once a page is generated, it will typically not be updated,
  whereas the browsers that later read the page can be updated by the user, therefore the browser is
  likely to have more up-to-date and finely-tuned heuristics than the markup generator did when
  generating the page.</p>
