  <h6>Reacting to environment changes</h6>

  <p id="img-environment-changes">The user agent may at any time run the following algorithm to update an <code>img</code>
  element's image in order to react to changes in the environment. (User agents are <em>not
  required</em> to ever run this algorithm; for example, if the user is not looking at the page any
  more, the user agent might want to wait until the user has returned to the page before determining
  which image to use, in case the environment changes again in the meantime.)</p>

  <p class=note>User agents are encouraged to run this algorithm in particular when the user changes
  the <span>viewport</span>'s size (e.g. by resizing the window or changing the page zoom), and when
  an <code>img</code> element is <span data-x="node is inserted into a document">inserted into a
  document</span>, so that the <span>density-corrected intrinsic width and height</span> match the
  new <span>viewport</span>, and so that the correct image is chosen when <span>art direction</span>
  is involved.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p><span>Await a stable state</span>. The <span>synchronous section</span>
   consists of all the remaining steps of this algorithm until the algorithm says the
   <span>synchronous section</span> has ended. (Steps in <span data-x="synchronous
   section">synchronous sections</span> are marked with &#x231B;.)</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; If the <code>img</code> element does not <span>use <code>srcset</code> or
   <code>picture</code></span>, its <span>node document</span> is not the <span>active
   document</span>, has image data whose resource type is <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code>, or
   the <span>pending request</span> is not null, then abort this algorithm.</p></li>

   <!-- we don't support replacing push-JPEG images because defining what happens with
   the tasks and events and so on in that case would become implausibly complicated. -->

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>selected source</var> and <var>selected pixel
   density</var> be the URL and pixel density that results from <span data-x="select an image source">selecting an image source</span>, respectively.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; If <var>selected source</var> is null, then abort these steps.</p></li>
   <!-- not sure this can ever actually happen -->

   <li><p>&#x231B; If <var>selected source</var> and <var>selected pixel
   density</var> are the same as the element's <span>last selected source</span> and <span>current
   pixel density</span>, then abort these steps.</p></li> <!-- note that this check happens before
   base URL resolution, so changing the base URL doesn't trigger an update if nothing else changed

   <li><p>&#x231B; <span data-x="parse a url">Parse</span> <var>selected source</var>, relative to
   the element's <span>node document</span>, and let <var>urlString</var> be the <span>resulting URL

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>corsAttributeState</var> be the state of the element's <code

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>origin</var> be the <span>origin</span> of the <code>img</code> element's <span>node document</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>client</var> be the <code>img</code> element's <span>node
   document</span>'s <code>Window</code> object's <span>environment settings object</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>&#x231B; Let <var>key</var> be a tuple consisting of <var>urlString</var>,

   <span>in parallel</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <span>list of available images</span> contains an entry for <var>key</var>,
    then set <var>image request</var>'s <span data-x="img-req-data">image data</span> to that of the entry.
    Continue to the next step.</p>

    <p>Otherwise:</p>

     <li><p>If <var>response</var>'s <span>unsafe response</span> is a <span>network error</span> or
     if the image format is unsupported (as determined by applying the <span

     or if the user agent is able to determine that <var>image request</var>'s image is corrupted in
     some fatal way such that the image dimensions cannot be obtained, or if the resource type is
     <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code>, then let <span>pending request</span> be null and abort
     these steps.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, <var>response</var>'s <span>unsafe response</span> is <var>image
     request</var>'s <span data-x="img-req-data">image data</span>. It can be either
     <span>CORS-same-origin</span> or <span>CORS-cross-origin</span>; this affects the
