  <h6>Updating the image data</h6>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>update the image data</dfn> of an <code>img</code> element,
  optionally with the <i>restart animations</i> flag set,
  it must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>If the element's <span>node document</span> is not the <span>active document</span>,
    then:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Continue running this algorithm <span>in parallel</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Wait until the element's <span>node document</span> is the <span>active document</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If another instance of this algorithm for this <code>img</code> element was started after this instance
     (even if it aborted and is no longer running), then abort these steps.</p></li>

     <li><p><span>Queue a microtask</span> to continue this algorithm.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the user agent cannot support images, or its support for images has been disabled, then
   <span>abort the image request</span> for the <span>current request</span> and the <span>pending request</span>,
   set <span>current request</span> to the <span data-x="img-none">unavailable</span> state,
   let <span>pending request</span> be null,
   and abort these steps.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If the element does not <span>use <code>srcset</code> or <code>picture</code></span>,
    and it has a <code data-x="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute specified and
    its value is not the empty string, let <var>selected source</var> be the value of the
    element's <code data-x="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute, and <var>selected pixel
    density</var> be 1.0. Otherwise, let <var>selected source</var> be null and <var>selected pixel density</var> be undefined.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let the <code>img</code> element's <span>last selected source</span> be <var>selected source</var>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>selected source</var> is not null, then:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p><span data-x="parse a url">Parse</span> <var>selected source</var>, relative to the
     element's <span>node document</span>. If that is not successful, then abort this inner set of
     steps. Otherwise, let <var>urlString</var> be the <span>resulting URL string</span>.</p></li>
     <!-- This does not change currentSrc -->

     <li><p>Let <var>key</var> be a tuple consisting of <var>urlString</var>, the <code>img</code>
     element's <code data-x="attr-img-crossorigin">crossorigin</code> attribute's mode, and, if that
     mode is not <span data-x="attr-crossorigin-none">No CORS</span>, the <span>node
     document</span>'s <span>origin</span>.</p></li>

     <li>

      <p>If the <span>list of available images</span> contains an entry for <var>key</var>,
      then:</p>

      <ol>

        <li><p>Set the <span>ignore higher-layer caching</span> flag for that entry.</p></li>

        <li><p><span>Abort the image request</span> for the <span>current request</span> and the

        <li><p>Let <span>pending request</span> be null.</p></li>

        <li><p>Let <span>current request</span> be a new <span>image request</span> whose <span
        data-x="img-req-data">image data</span> is that of the entry and whose state is set to the
        <span data-x="img-all">completely available</span> state.</p></li>

        <li><p>Update the presentation of the image appropriately.</p></li>

        <li><p>Let the <span>current request</span>'s <span>current pixel density</span> be
        <var>selected pixel density</var>.</p></li>

        <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to <span>restart the animation</span> if <i>restart
