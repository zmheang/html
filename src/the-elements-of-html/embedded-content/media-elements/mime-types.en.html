  <h5>MIME types</h5>

  <p>A <span>media resource</span> can be described in terms of its <em>type</em>, specifically a
  <span>MIME type</span>, in some cases with a <code data-x="">codecs</code> parameter. (Whether the
  <code data-x="">codecs</code> parameter is allowed or not depends on the MIME type.) <ref spec=RFC6381></p>

  <p>Types are usually somewhat incomplete descriptions; for example "<code
  data-x="">video/mpeg</code>" doesn't say anything except what the container type is, and even a
  type like "<code data-x="">video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;</code>" doesn't
  include information like the actual bitrate (only the maximum bitrate). Thus, given a type, a user
  agent can often only know whether it <em>might</em> be able to play media of that type (with
  varying levels of confidence), or whether it definitely <em>cannot</em> play media of that
  type.</p>

  <p><dfn>A type that the user agent knows it cannot render</dfn> is one that describes a resource
  that the user agent definitely does not support, for example because it doesn't recognize the
  container type, or it doesn't support the listed codecs.</p>

  <p>The <span>MIME type</span> "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" with no parameters is never
  <span>a type that the user agent knows it cannot render</span>. User agents must treat that type
  as equivalent to the lack of any explicit <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span>
  when it is used to label a potential <span>media resource</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">Only the <span>MIME type</span> "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" with no
  parameters is special-cased here; if any parameter appears with it, it will be treated just like
  any other <span>MIME type</span>. This is a deviation from the rule <!-- in RFC 2046, section 1,
  paragraph 3 --> that unknown <span>MIME type</span> parameters <!--non-normative-->should be
  ignored.</p> <!-- but not really a "willful violation" since it's not that the types are not being
  ignored, just that before the type is handled as a type, there's a special case for a particular
  set of strings -->

  <dl class="domintro">

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-navigator-canPlayType">canPlayType</code>(<var>type</var>)</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Returns the empty string (a negative response), "maybe", or "probably" based on how confident
    the user agent is that it can play media resources of the given type.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-navigator-canPlayType">canPlayType(<var>type</var>)</code></dfn> method must return <dfn data-x="dom-CanPlayTypeResult-nil">the
  empty string</dfn> if <var>type</var> is <span>a type that the user agent knows it cannot
  render</span> or is the type "<code>application/octet-stream</code>"; it must return "<dfn><code data-x="dom-CanPlayTypeResult-probably">probably</code></dfn>" if the user agent is confident
  that the type represents a <span>media resource</span> that it can render if used in with this
  <code>audio</code> or <code>video</code> element; and it must return "<dfn><code data-x="dom-CanPlayTypeResult-maybe">maybe</code></dfn>" otherwise. Implementors are encouraged
  to return "<code data-x="dom-CanPlayTypeResult-maybe">maybe</code>" unless the type can be
  confidently established as being supported or not. Generally, a user agent should never return
  "<code data-x="dom-CanPlayTypeResult-probably">probably</code>" for a type that allows the <code
  data-x="">codecs</code> parameter if that parameter is not present.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This script tests to see if the user agent supports a (fictional) new format to dynamically
   decide whether to use a <code>video</code> element or a plugin:</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;section id="video">
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="playing-cats.nfv">Download video&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>
&lt;script>
 var videoSection = document.getElementById('video');
 var videoElement = document.createElement('video');
 var support = videoElement.canPlayType('video/x-new-fictional-format;codecs="kittens,bunnies"');
 if (support != "probably" &amp;&amp; "New Fictional Video Plugin" in navigator.plugins) {
   // not confident of browser support
   // but we have a plugin
   // so use plugin instead
   videoElement = document.createElement("embed");
 } else if (support == "") {
   // no support from browser and no plugin
   // do nothing
   videoElement = null;
 }
 if (videoElement) {
   while (videoSection.hasChildNodes())
     videoSection.removeChild(videoSection.firstChild);
   videoElement.setAttribute("src", "playing-cats.nfv");
   videoSection.appendChild(videoElement);
 }
&lt;/script></code></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">The <code data-x="attr-source-type">type</code> attribute of the
  <code>source</code> element allows the user agent to avoid downloading resources that use formats
  it cannot render.</p>
