  <div w-nodev>

  <p>A <span>media resource</span> has a <dfn>media timeline</dfn> that maps times (in seconds) to
  positions in the <span>media resource</span>. The origin of a timeline is its earliest defined
  position. The duration of a timeline is its last defined position.</p>

  <p><dfn id="defineTimeline" data-x="establish the media timeline">Establishing the media
  timeline</dfn>: if the <span>media resource</span> somehow specifies an explicit timeline whose
  origin is not negative (i.e. gives each frame a specific time offset and gives the first frame a
  zero or positive offset), then the <span>media timeline</span> should be that timeline. (Whether
  the <span>media resource</span> can specify a timeline or not depends on the <span data-x="media
  resource">media resource's</span> format.) If the <span>media resource</span> specifies an
  explicit start time <em>and date</em>, then that time and date should be considered the zero point
  in the <span>media timeline</span>; the <span>timeline offset</span> will be the time and date,
  exposed using the <code data-x="dom-media-getStartDate">getStartDate()</code> method.</p>

  <p>If the <span>media resource</span> has a discontinuous timeline, the user agent must extend the
  timeline used at the start of the resource across the entire resource, so that the <span>media
  timeline</span> of the <span>media resource</span> increases linearly starting from the
  <span>earliest possible position</span> (as defined below), even if the underlying <span>media
  data</span> has out-of-order or even overlapping time codes.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, if two clips have been concatenated into one video file, but the
  video format exposes the original times for the two clips, the video data might expose a timeline
  that goes, say, 00:15..00:29 and then 00:05..00:38. However, the user agent would not expose those
  times; it would instead expose the times as 00:15..00:29 and 00:29..01:02, as a single video.</p>

  <p>
  <!--INSERT TRACKING-->
  In the rare case of a <span>media resource</span> that does not have an explicit timeline, the
  zero time on the <span>media timeline</span> should correspond to the first frame of the
  <span>media resource</span>. In the even rarer case of a <span>media resource</span> with no
  explicit timings of any kind, not even frame durations, the user agent must itself determine the
  time for each frame in an <span>implementation-defined</span> manner.</p>

  <p class="note">An example of a file format with no explicit timeline but with explicit frame
  durations is the Animated GIF format. An example of a file format with no explicit timings at all
  is the JPEG-push format (<code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> with JPEG frames, often
  used as the format for MJPEG streams).</p>

  <p>If, in the case of a resource with no timing information, the user agent will nonetheless be
  able to seek to an earlier point than the first frame originally provided by the server, then the
  zero time should correspond to the earliest seekable time of the <span>media resource</span>;
  otherwise, it should correspond to the first frame received from the server (the point in the
  <span>media resource</span> at which the user agent began receiving the stream).</p>

  <p class="note">At the time of writing, there is no known format that lacks explicit frame time
  offsets yet still supports seeking to a frame before the first frame sent by the server.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider a stream from a TV broadcaster, which begins streaming on a sunny Friday afternoon in
   October, and always sends connecting user agents the media data on the same media timeline, with
   its zero time set to the start of this stream. Months later, user agents connecting to this
   stream will find that the first frame they receive has a time with millions of seconds. The <code
   data-x="dom-media-getStartDate">getStartDate()</code> method would always return the date that the
   broadcast started; this would allow controllers to display real times in their scrubber (e.g.
   "2:30pm") rather than a time relative to when the broadcast began ("8 months, 4 hours, 12
   minutes, and 23 seconds").</p>

   <p>Consider a stream that carries a video with several concatenated fragments, broadcast by a
   server that does not allow user agents to request specific times but instead just streams the
   video data in a predetermined order, with the first frame delivered always being identified as
   the frame with time zero. If a user agent connects to this stream and receives fragments defined
   as covering timestamps 2010-03-20 23:15:00 UTC to 2010-03-21 00:05:00 UTC and 2010-02-12 14:25:00
   UTC to 2010-02-12 14:35:00 UTC, it would expose this with a <span>media timeline</span> starting
   at 0s and extending to 3,600s (one hour). Assuming the streaming server disconnected at the end
   of the second clip, the <code data-x="dom-media-duration">duration</code> attribute would then
   return 3,600. The <code data-x="dom-media-getStartDate">getStartDate()</code> method would return a
   <code>Date</code> object with a time corresponding to 2010-03-20 23:15:00 UTC. However, if a
   different user agent connected five minutes later, <em>it</em> would (presumably) receive
   fragments covering timestamps 2010-03-20 23:20:00 UTC to 2010-03-21 00:05:00 UTC and 2010-02-12
   14:25:00 UTC to 2010-02-12 14:35:00 UTC, and would expose this with a <span>media timeline</span>
   starting at 0s and extending to 3,300s (fifty five minutes). In this case, the <code
   data-x="dom-media-getStartDate">getStartDate()</code> method would return a <code>Date</code> object
   with a time corresponding to 2010-03-20 23:20:00 UTC.</p>

   <p>In both of these examples, the <code data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute
   would give the ranges that the controller would want to actually display in its UI; typically, if
   the servers don't support seeking to arbitrary times, this would be the range of time from the
   moment the user agent connected to the stream up to the latest frame that the user agent has
   obtained; however, if the user agent starts discarding earlier information, the actual range
   might be shorter.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In any case, the user agent must ensure that the <span>earliest possible position</span> (as
  defined below) using the established <span>media timeline</span>, is greater than or equal to
  zero.</p>

  <p>The <span>media timeline</span> also has an associated clock. Which clock is used is user-agent
  defined, and may be <span>media resource</span>-dependent, but it should approximate the user's
  wall clock.</p>

  <p><span data-x="media element">Media elements</span> have a <dfn>current playback position</dfn>,
  which must initially (i.e. in the absence of <span>media data</span>) be zero seconds. The
  <span>current playback position</span> is a time on the <span>media timeline</span>.</p>

  <p><span data-x="media element">Media elements</span> also have an <dfn>official playback
  position</dfn>, which must initially be set to zero seconds. The <span>official playback
  position</span> is an approximation of the <span>current playback position</span> that is kept
  stable while scripts are running.</p>

  <p><span data-x="media element">Media elements</span> also have a <dfn>default playback start
  position</dfn>, which must initially be set to zero seconds. This time is used to allow the
  element to be seeked even before the media is loaded.</p>

  <p>Each <span>media element</span> has a <dfn>show poster flag</dfn>. When a <span>media
  element</span> is created, this flag must be set to true. This flag is used to control when the
  user agent is to show a poster frame for a <code>video</code> element instead of showing the video
  contents.</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-currentTime">currentTime</code></dfn> attribute must, on
  getting, return the <span>media element</span>'s <span>default playback start position</span>,
  unless that is zero, in which case it must return the element's <span>official playback
  position</span>. The returned value must be expressed in seconds. On setting, if the <span>media
  element</span>'s <code data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> is <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code>, then it must set the <span>media
  element</span>'s <span>default playback start position</span> to the new value; otherwise, it must
  set the <span>official playback position</span> to the new value and then <span
  data-x="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the new value. The new value must be interpreted as being in
  seconds.</p>

  <p>If the <span>media resource</span> is a streaming resource, then the user agent might be unable
  to obtain certain parts of the resource after it has expired from its buffer. Similarly, some
  <span data-x="media resource">media resources</span> might have a <span>media timeline</span> that
  doesn't start at zero. The <dfn>earliest possible position</dfn> is the earliest position in the
  stream or resource that the user agent can ever obtain again. It is also a time on the <span>media
  timeline</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>earliest possible position</span> is not explicitly exposed in the API;
  it corresponds to the start time of the first range in the <code
  data-x="dom-media-seekable">seekable</code> attribute's <code>TimeRanges</code> object, if any, or
  the <span>current playback position</span> otherwise.</p>

  <p>When the <span>earliest possible position</span> changes, then: if the <span>current playback
  position</span> is before the <span>earliest possible position</span>, the user agent must <span
  data-x="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the <span>earliest possible position</span>; otherwise, if
  the user agent has not fired a <code data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> event at
  the element in the past 15 to 250ms and is not still running event handlers for such an event,
  then the user agent must <span>queue a media element task</span> given the <span>media
  element</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> at the element.</p>

  <p class="note">Because of the above requirement and the requirement in the <span
  data-x="concept-media-load-resource">resource fetch algorithm</span> that kicks in <a
  href="#getting-media-metadata">when the metadata of the clip becomes known</a>, the <span>current
  playback position</span> can never be less than the <span>earliest possible position</span>.</p>

  <!-- see https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14492 -->
  <!-- basically this is to handle very-long-running streams that use different video and audio
       tracks per TV show -->

  <p>If at any time the user agent learns that an audio or video track has ended and all <span>media
  data</span> relating to that track corresponds to parts of the <span>media timeline</span> that
  are <em>before</em> the <span>earliest possible position</span>, the user agent may <span>queue a
  media element task</span> given the <span>media element</span> to run these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Remove the track from the <code data-x="dom-media-audioTracks">audioTracks</code>
   attribute's <code>AudioTrackList</code> object or the <code
   data-x="dom-media-videoTracks">videoTracks</code> attribute's <code>VideoTrackList</code> object
   as appropriate.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code
   data-x="event-media-removetrack">removetrack</code> at the <span>media element</span>'s
   aforementioned <code>AudioTrackList</code> or <code>VideoTrackList</code> object, using
   <code>TrackEvent</code>, with the <code data-x="dom-TrackEvent-track">track</code> attribute
   initialized to the <code>AudioTrack</code> or <code>VideoTrack</code> object representing the
   track.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code
  data-x="dom-media-duration">duration</code></dfn> attribute must return the time of the end of the
  <span>media resource</span>, in seconds, on the <span>media timeline</span>. If no <span>media
  data</span> is available, then the attributes must return the Not-a-Number (NaN) value. If the
  <span>media resource</span> is not known to be bounded (e.g. streaming radio, or a live event with
  no announced end time), then the attribute must return the positive Infinity value.</p>

  <p>The user agent must determine the duration of the <span>media resource</span> before playing
  any part of the <span>media data</span> and before setting <code
  data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> to a value equal to or greater than <code
  data-x="dom-media-HAVE_METADATA">HAVE_METADATA</code>, even if doing so requires fetching multiple
  parts of the resource.</p>

  <p id="durationChange">When the length of the <span>media resource</span> changes to a known value
  (e.g. from being unknown to known, or from a previously established length to a new length) the
  user agent must <span>queue a media element task</span> given the <span>media element</span> to
  <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-media-durationchange">durationchange</code> at the <span>media element</span>. (The
  event is not fired when the duration is reset as part of loading a new media resource.) If the
  duration is changed such that the <span>current playback position</span> ends up being greater
  than the time of the end of the <span>media resource</span>, then the user agent must also <span
  data-x="dom-media-seek">seek</span> to the time of the end of the <span>media resource</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">If an "infinite" stream ends for some reason, then the duration would change
  from positive Infinity to the time of the last frame or sample in the stream, and the <code
  data-x="event-media-durationchange">durationchange</code> event would be fired. Similarly, if the
  user agent initially estimated the <span>media resource</span>'s duration instead of determining
  it precisely, and later revises the estimate based on new information, then the duration would
  change and the <code data-x="event-media-durationchange">durationchange</code> event would be
  fired.</p>

  <p>Some video files also have an explicit date and time corresponding to the zero time in the
  <span>media timeline</span>, known as the <dfn>timeline offset</dfn>. Initially, the
  <span>timeline offset</span> must be set to Not-a-Number (NaN).</p>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-getStartDate">getStartDate()</code></dfn> method must return <span
  data-x="create a Date object">a new <code>Date</code> object</span> representing the current
  <span>timeline offset</span>.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code data-x="attr-media-loop">loop</code></dfn> attribute is
  a <span>boolean attribute</span> that, if specified, indicates that the <span>media element</span>
  is to seek back to the start of the <span>media resource</span> upon reaching the end.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code data-x="dom-media-loop">loop</code></dfn> IDL
  attribute must <span>reflect</span> the content attribute of the same name.</p>
