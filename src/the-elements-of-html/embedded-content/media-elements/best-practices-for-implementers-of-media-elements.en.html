  <h5>Best practices for implementers of media elements</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>How accurately various aspects of the <span>media element</span> API are implemented is
  considered a quality-of-implementation issue.</p>

  <p>For example, when implementing the <code data-x="dom-media-buffered">buffered</code> attribute,
  how precise an implementation reports the ranges that have been buffered depends on how carefully
  the user agent inspects the data. Since the API reports ranges as times, but the data is obtained
  in byte streams, a user agent receiving a variable-bitrate stream might only be able to determine
  precise times by actually decoding all of the data. User agents aren't required to do this,
  however; they can instead return estimates (e.g. based on the average bitrate seen so far) which
  get revised as more information becomes available.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, user agents are urged to be conservative rather than optimistic. For
  example, it would be bad to report that everything had been buffered when it had not.</p>

  <p>Another quality-of-implementation issue would be playing a video backwards when the codec is
  designed only for forward playback (e.g. there aren't many key frames, and they are far apart, and
  the intervening frames only have deltas from the previous frame). User agents could do a poor job,
  e.g. only showing key frames; however, better implementations would do more work and thus do a
  better job, e.g. actually decoding parts of the video forwards, storing the complete frames, and
  then playing the frames backwards.</p>

  <p>Similarly, while implementations are allowed to drop buffered data at any time (there is no
  requirement that a user agent keep all the media data obtained for the lifetime of the media
  element), it is again a quality of implementation issue: user agents with sufficient resources to
  keep all the data around are encouraged to do so, as this allows for a better user experience. For
  example, if the user is watching a live stream, a user agent could allow the user only to view the
  live video; however, a better user agent would buffer everything and allow the user to seek
  through the earlier material, pause it, play it forwards and backwards, etc.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When a <span>media element</span> that is paused is <span data-x="node is removed from a
  document">removed from a document</span> and not reinserted before the next time the <span>event
  loop</span> reaches <a href="#step1">step 1</a>, implementations that are resource constrained are encouraged to take
  that opportunity to release all hardware resources (like video planes, networking resources, and
  data buffers) used by the <span>media element</span>. (User agents still have to keep track of the
  playback position and so forth, though, in case playback is later restarted.)</p>
