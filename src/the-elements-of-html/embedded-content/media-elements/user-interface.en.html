  <h5>User interface</h5>

  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code data-x="attr-media-controls">controls</code></dfn>
  attribute is a <span>boolean attribute</span>. If present, it indicates that the author has not
  provided a scripted controller and would like the user agent to provide its own set of
  controls.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>If the attribute is present, or if <span data-x="concept-n-noscript">scripting is
  disabled</span> for the <span>media element</span>, then the user agent should <dfn>expose a user
  interface to the user</dfn>. This user interface should include features to begin playback, pause
  playback, seek to an arbitrary position in the content (if the content supports arbitrary
  seeking), change the volume, change the display of closed captions or embedded sign-language
  tracks, select different audio tracks or turn on audio descriptions, and show the media content in
  manners more suitable to the user (e.g. fullscreen video or in an independent resizable window).
  Other controls may also be made available.</p>

  <p>Even when the attribute is absent, however, user agents may provide controls to affect playback
  of the media resource (e.g. play, pause, seeking, track selection, and volume controls), but such
  features should not interfere with the page's normal rendering. For example, such features could
  be exposed in the <span>media element</span>'s context menu, platform media keys, or a remote
  control. The user agent may implement this simply by <span data-x="expose a user interface to the
  user">exposing a user interface to the user</span> as described above (as if the <code
  data-x="attr-media-controls">controls</code> attribute was present).</p>

  <p>If the user agent <span data-x="expose a user interface to the user">exposes a user interface to
  the user</span> by displaying controls over the <span>media element</span>, then the user agent
  should suppress any user interaction events while the user agent is interacting with this
  interface. (For example, if the user clicks on a video's playback control, <code
  data-x="event-mousedown">mousedown</code> events and so forth would not simultaneously be fired at
  elements on the page.)</p>

  <p>Where possible (specifically, for starting, stopping, pausing, and unpausing playback, for
  seeking, for changing the rate of playback, for fast-forwarding or rewinding, for listing,
  enabling, and disabling text tracks, and for muting or changing the volume of the audio), user
  interface features exposed by the user agent must be implemented in terms of the DOM API described
  above, so that, e.g., all the same events fire.</p>

  <p>Features such as fast-forward or rewind must be implemented by only changing the <code
  data-x="">playbackRate</code> attribute (and not the <code data-x="">defaultPlaybackRate</code>
  attribute).</p>

  <p>Seeking must be implemented in terms of <span data-x="dom-media-seek">seeking</span> to the
  requested position in the <span>media element</span>'s <span>media timeline</span>. For media
  resources where seeking to an arbitrary position would be slow, user agents are encouraged to use
  the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag when seeking in response to the user manipulating an
  approximate position interface such as a seek bar.</p>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code
  data-x="dom-media-controls">controls</code></dfn> IDL attribute must <span>reflect</span> the
  content attribute of the same name.</p>

  <dl class="domintro">

    <p>Can be set, to change the volume.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><var>media</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Returns true if audio is muted, overriding the <code data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code>
    attribute, and false if the <code data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code> attribute is being
    honored.</p>

    <p>Can be set, to change whether the audio is muted or not.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> has a <dfn data-x="concept-media-volume">playback volume</dfn>, which is a fraction in the range 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (loudest).
  Initially, the volume should be 1.0, but user agents may remember the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise, so the volume may start at other values.</p>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code></dfn>
  IDL attribute must return the <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback volume</span> of any
  audio portions of the <span>media element</span>. On setting, if the new value is in the range 0.0
  to 1.0 inclusive, the <span>media element</span>'s <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback
  volume</span> must be set to the new value. If the new value is outside the range 0.0 to 1.0
  inclusive, then, on setting, an <span>"<code>IndexSizeError</code>"</span>
  <code>DOMException</code> must be thrown instead.</p>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> can also be <dfn data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</dfn>. If
  anything is muting the element, then it is muted. (For example, when the <span>direction of
  playback</span> is backwards, the element is muted.)</p>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code></dfn> IDL
  attribute must return the value to which it was last set. When a <span>media element</span> is
  created, if the element has a <code data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code> content attribute
  specified, then the <code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> IDL attribute should be set to
  true; otherwise, the user agents may set the value to the user's preferred value (e.g. remembering
  the last set value across sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise). While the <code
  data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> IDL attribute is set to true, the <span>media element</span>
  must be <span data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>.</p>

  <p>Whenever either of the values that would be returned by the <code
  data-x="dom-media-volume">volume</code> and <code data-x="dom-media-muted">muted</code> IDL
  attributes change, the user agent must <span>queue a media element task</span> given the
  <span>media element</span> to <span data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code
  data-x="event-media-volumechange">volumechange</code> at the <span>media element</span>. Then, if
  the <span>media element</span> is not <span>allowed to play</span>, the user agent must run the
  <span>internal pause steps</span> for the <span>media element</span>.</p>

  <p>An element's <dfn>effective media volume</dfn> is determined as follows:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If the user has indicated that the user agent is to override the volume of the element,
   then return the volume desired by the user.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element's audio output is <span data-x="concept-media-muted">muted</span>, then
   return zero.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>volume</var> be the <span data-x="concept-media-volume">playback
   volume</span> of the audio portions of the <span>media element</span>, in range 0.0 (silent) to
   1.0 (loudest).</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var>volume</var>, interpreted relative to the range 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being
   silent, and 1.0 being the loudest setting, values in between increasing in loudness. The range
   need not be linear. The loudest setting may be lower than the system's loudest possible setting;
   for example the user could have set a maximum volume.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code></dfn> content
  attribute on <span data-x="media element">media elements</span> is a <span>boolean
  attribute</span> that controls the default state of the audio output of the <span>media
  resource</span>, potentially overriding user preferences.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-media-defaultMuted">defaultMuted</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the <code data-x="attr-media-muted">muted</code> content attribute.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="note">This attribute has no dynamic effect (it only controls the default state of the
  element).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This video (an advertisement) autoplays, but to avoid annoying users, it does so without
   sound, and allows the user to turn the sound on. The user agent can pause the video if it's
   unmuted without a user interaction.</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;video src="adverts.cgi?kind=video" controls autoplay loop muted>&lt;/video></code></pre>
