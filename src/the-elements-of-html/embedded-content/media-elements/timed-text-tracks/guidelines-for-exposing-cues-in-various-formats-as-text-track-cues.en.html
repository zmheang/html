  <h6><dfn>Guidelines for exposing cues</dfn> in various formats as <span data-x="text track
  cue">text track cues</span></h6>

  <p>How a specific format's text track cues are to be interpreted for the purposes of processing by
  an HTML user agent is defined by that format. In the absence of such a specification, this section
  provides some constraints within which implementations can attempt to consistently expose such
  formats.</p>

  <p>To support the <span>text track</span> model of HTML, each unit of timed data is converted to a
  <span>text track cue</span>. Where the mapping of the format's features to the aspects of a
  <span>text track cue</span> as defined in this specification are not defined, implementations must
  ensure that the mapping is consistent with the definitions of the aspects of a <span>text track
  cue</span> as defined above, as well as with the following constraints:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>The <span>text track cue identifier</span>
   <dd>
    <p>Should be set to the empty string if the format has no obvious analogue to a per-cue
    identifier.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>The <span>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</span>
   <dd>
    <p>Should be set to false.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>
