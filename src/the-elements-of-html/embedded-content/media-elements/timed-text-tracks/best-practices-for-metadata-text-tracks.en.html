  <h6>Best practices for metadata text tracks</h6>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Text tracks can be used for storing data relating to the media data, for interactive or
  augmented views.</p>

  <p>For example, a page showing a sports broadcast could include information about the current
  score. Suppose a robotics competition was being streamed live. The image could be overlayed with
  the scores, as follows:</p>

  <p><iframe src="data:text/html;charset=utf-8,%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cstyle%3E%0A%20body%2C%20html%20%7B%20margin%3A%200%3B%20padding%3A%200%3B%20overflow%3A%20hidden%3B%20%7D%0A%20div%20%7B%20width%3A%20600px%3B%20height%3A%20400px%3B%20position%3A%20relative%3B%20%7D%0A%20p%20%7B%20position%3A%20absolute%3B%20top%3A%200%3B%20margin%3A%200.25em%3B%20font%3A%20small-caps%20900%202em%20sans-serif%3B%20text-shadow%3A%20white%200%200%204px%3B%20%7D%0A%20span%20%7B%20display%3A%20block%3B%20%7D%0A%20.left%20%7B%20color%3A%20red%3B%20left%3A%200%3B%20text-align%3A%20left%3B%20%7D%0A%20.right%20%7B%20color%3A%20blue%3B%20right%3A%200%3B%20text-align%3A%20right%3B%20%7D%0A%20.middle%20%7B%20color%3A%20white%3B%20top%3A%20auto%3B%20bottom%3A%200%3B%20left%3A%200%3B%20right%3A%200%3B%20text-align%3A%20center%3B%20text-shadow%3A%20black%200%200%204px%3B%20%7D%0A%20.middle%20span%20%7B%20display%3A%20inline-block%3B%20margin%3A%200%201em%3B%20font-size%3A%200.75em%3B%20text-transform%3A%20uppercase%3B%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A%3Cdiv%3E%0A%20%3Cimg%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fhtml.spec.whatwg.org%2Fimages%2Frobots.jpeg%22%3E%0A%20%3Cp%20class%3D%22score%20left%22%3E%3Cspan%3ERed%20Alliance%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%3E78%3C%2Fspan%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%20%3Cp%20class%3D%22score%20right%22%3E%3Cspan%3EBlue%20Alliance%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%3E66%3C%2Fspan%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%20%3Cp%20class%3D%22score%20middle%22%3E%3Cspan%3EQual%20Match%2037%3C%2Fspan%3E%20%3Cspan%3EFriday%2014%3A21%3C%2Fspan%3E%0A%3C%2Fdiv%3E" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

  <p>In order to make the score display render correctly whenever the user seeks to an arbitrary
  point in the video, the metadata text track cues need to be as long as is appropriate for the
  score. For example, in the frame above, there would be maybe one cue that lasts the length of the
  match that gives the match number, one cue that lasts until the blue alliance's score changes, and
  one cue that lasts until the red alliance's score changes. If the video is just a stream of the
  live event, the time in the bottom right would presumably be automatically derived from the
  current video time, rather than based on a cue. However, if the video was just the highlights,
  then that might be given in cues also.</p>

  <p>The following shows what fragments of this could look like in a WebVTT file:</p>

  <pre>WEBVTT

...

05:10:00.000 --> 05:12:15.000
matchtype:qual
matchnumber:37

...

05:11:02.251 --> 05:11:17.198
red:78

05:11:03.672 --> 05:11:54.198
blue:66

05:11:17.198 --> 05:11:25.912
red:80

05:11:25.912 --> 05:11:26.522
red:83

05:11:26.522 --> 05:11:26.982
red:86

05:11:26.982 --> 05:11:27.499
red:89

...</pre>

  <p>The key here is to notice that the information is given in cues that span the length of time to
  which the relevant event applies. If, instead, the scores were given as zero-length (or very
  brief, nearly zero-length) cues when the score changes, for example saying "red+2" at
  05:11:17.198, "red+3" at 05:11:25.912, etc, problems arise: primarily, seeking is much harder to
  implement, as the script has to walk the entire list of cues to make sure that no notifications
  have been missed; but also, if the cues are short it's possible the script will never see that
  they are active unless it listens to them specifically.</p>

  <p>When using cues in this manner, authors are encouraged to use the <code
  data-x="event-media-cuechange">cuechange</code> event to update the current annotations. (In
  particular, using the <code data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> event would be less
  appropriate as it would require doing work even when the cues haven't changed, and, more
  importantly, would introduce a higher latency between when the metadata cues become active and
  when the display is updated, since <code data-x="event-media-timeupdate">timeupdate</code> events
  are rate-limited.)</p>
