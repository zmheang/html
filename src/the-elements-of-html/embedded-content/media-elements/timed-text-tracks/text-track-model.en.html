  <h6>Text track model</h6>

  <p>A <span>media element</span> can have a group of associated <dfn data-x="text track">text
  tracks</dfn>, known as the <span>media element</span>'s <dfn>list of text tracks</dfn>. The <span
  data-x="text track">text tracks</span> are sorted as follows:</p>

  <ol class="brief">

   <li>The <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> corresponding to <code>track</code> element
   children of the <span>media element</span>, in <span>tree order</span>.</li>

   <li>Any <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> added using the <code
   data-x="dom-media-addTextTrack">addTextTrack()</code> method, in the order they were added, oldest
   first.</li>

   <li>Any <span data-x="media-resource-specific text track">media-resource-specific text
   tracks</span> (<span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> corresponding to data in the
   <span>media resource</span>), in the order defined by the <span>media resource</span>'s format
   specification.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>A <span>text track</span> consists of:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track kind">The kind of text track</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>This decides how the track is handled by the user agent. The kind is represented by a string.
    The possible strings are:</p>

    <ul class="brief">
     <li><dfn><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-subtitles">subtitles</code></dfn>
     <li><dfn><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-captions">captions</code></dfn>
     <li><dfn><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-descriptions">descriptions</code></dfn>
     <li><dfn><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-chapters">chapters</code></dfn>
     <li><dfn><code data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-metadata">metadata</code></dfn>
    </ul>

    <p>The <span data-x="text track kind">kind of track</span> can change dynamically, in the case of
    a <span>text track</span> corresponding to a <code>track</code> element.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track label">A label</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>This is a human-readable string intended to identify the track for the user.</p>

    <p>The <span data-x="text track label">label of a track</span> can change dynamically, in the
    case of a <span>text track</span> corresponding to a <code>track</code> element.</p>

    <p>When a <span>text track label</span> is the empty string, the user agent should automatically
    generate an appropriate label from the text track's other properties (e.g. the kind of text
    track and the text track's language) for use in its user interface. This automatically-generated
    label is not exposed in the API.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track in-band metadata track dispatch type">An in-band metadata track dispatch type</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>This is a string extracted from the <span>media resource</span> specifically for in-band
    metadata tracks to enable such tracks to be dispatched to different scripts in the document.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, a traditional TV station broadcast streamed on the Web and
    augmented with Web-specific interactive features could include text tracks with metadata for ad
    targeting, trivia game data during game shows, player states during sports games, recipe
    information during food programs, and so forth. As each program starts and ends, new tracks
    might be added or removed from the stream, and as each one is added, the user agent could bind
    them to dedicated script modules using the value of this attribute.</p>

    <p>Other than for in-band metadata text tracks, the <span data-x="text track in-band metadata
    track dispatch type">in-band metadata track dispatch type</span> is the empty string. How this
    value is populated for different media formats is described in <span>steps to expose a
    media-resource-specific text track</span>.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track language">A language</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>This is a string (a BCP 47 language tag) representing the language of the text track's cues.
    <ref spec=BCP47></p>

    <p>The <span data-x="text track language">language of a text track</span> can change dynamically,
    in the case of a <span>text track</span> corresponding to a <code>track</code> element.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track readiness state">A readiness state</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track not loaded">Not loaded</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track's cues have not been obtained.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track loading">Loading</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track is loading and there have been no fatal errors encountered so
      far. Further cues might still be added to the track by the parser.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track loaded">Loaded</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track has been loaded with no fatal errors.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track failed to load">Failed to load</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track was enabled, but when the user agent attempted to obtain it,
      this failed in some way (e.g. <span>URL</span> could not be <span data-x="parse a
      url">parsed</span>, network error, unknown text track format). Some or all of the cues are
      likely missing and will not be obtained.</p>

     </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>The <span data-x="text track readiness state">readiness state</span> of a <span>text
    track</span> changes dynamically as the track is obtained.</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track mode">A mode</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track disabled">Disabled</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track is not active. Other than for the purposes of exposing the
      track in the DOM, the user agent is ignoring the text track. No cues are active, no events are
      fired, and the user agent will not attempt to obtain the track's cues.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track hidden">Hidden</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track is active, but that the user agent is not actively displaying
      the cues. If no attempt has yet been made to obtain the track's cues, the user agent will
      perform such an attempt momentarily. The user agent is maintaining a list of which cues are
      active, and events are being fired accordingly.</p>

     </dd>

     <dt><dfn data-x="text track showing">Showing</dfn>

     <dd>

      <p>Indicates that the text track is active. If no attempt has yet been made to obtain the
      track's cues, the user agent will perform such an attempt momentarily. The user agent is
      maintaining a list of which cues are active, and events are being fired accordingly. In
      addition, for text tracks whose <span data-x="text track kind">kind</span> is <code
      data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-subtitles">subtitles</code> or <code
      data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-captions">captions</code>, the cues are being overlaid on the video
      as appropriate; for text tracks whose <span data-x="text track kind">kind</span> is <code
      data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-descriptions">descriptions</code>, the user agent is making the
      cues available to the user in a non-visual fashion; and for text tracks whose <span
      data-x="text track kind">kind</span> is <code
      data-x="dom-TextTrack-kind-chapters">chapters</code>, the user agent is making available to
      the user a mechanism by which the user can navigate to any point in the <span>media
      resource</span> by selecting a cue.</p>

     </dd>

    </dl>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track list of cues">A list of zero or more cues</dfn>

   <dd>

    <p>A list of <span data-x="text track cue">text track cues</span>, along with <dfn>rules for
    updating the text track rendering</dfn>. For example, for WebVTT, the <span>rules for updating
    the display of WebVTT text tracks</span>. <ref spec=WEBVTT> </p>

    <p>The <span data-x="text track list of cues">list of cues of a text track</span> can change
    dynamically, either because the <span>text track</span> has <span data-x="text track not
    loaded">not yet been loaded</span> or is still <span data-x="text track loading">loading</span>,
    or due to DOM manipulation.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>Each <span>text track</span> has a corresponding <code>TextTrack</code> object.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Each <span>media element</span> has a <dfn>list of pending text tracks</dfn>, which must
  initially be empty, a <dfn>blocked-on-parser</dfn> flag, which must initially be false, and a
  <dfn>did-perform-automatic-track-selection</dfn> flag, which must also initially be false.</p>

  <p>When the user agent is required to <dfn>populate the list of pending text tracks</dfn> of a
  <span>media element</span>, the user agent must add to the element's <span>list of pending text
  tracks</span> each <span>text track</span> in the element's <span>list of text tracks</span> whose
  <span>text track mode</span> is not <span data-x="text track disabled">disabled</span> and whose
  <span>text track readiness state</span> is <!--either <span data-x="text track not loaded">not
  loaded</span> or [there can't be any in the 'not loaded' state that are not 'disabled']--> <span
  data-x="text track loading">loading</span>.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <code>track</code> element's parent node changes, the user agent must remove the
  corresponding <span>text track</span> from any <span>list of pending text tracks</span> that it is
  in.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <span>text track</span>'s <span>text track readiness state</span> changes to either
  <span data-x="text track loaded">loaded</span> or <span data-x="text track failed to load">failed to
  load</span>, the user agent must remove it from any <span>list of pending text tracks</span> that
  it is in.</p>

  <p>When a <span>media element</span> is created by an <span>HTML parser</span> or <span>XML
  parser</span>, the user agent must set the element's <span>blocked-on-parser</span> flag to true.
  When a <span>media element</span> is popped off the <span>stack of open elements</span> of an
  <span>HTML parser</span> or <span>XML parser</span>, the user agent must <span>honor user
  preferences for automatic text track selection</span>, <span>populate the list of pending text
  tracks</span>, and set the element's <span>blocked-on-parser</span> flag to false.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> of a <span>media element</span> are <dfn
  data-x="the text tracks are ready">ready</dfn> when both the element's <span>list of pending text
  tracks</span> is empty and the element's <span>blocked-on-parser</span> flag is false.</p>

  <p>Each <span>media element</span> has a <dfn>pending text track change notification flag</dfn>,
  which must initially be unset.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <span>text track</span> that is in a <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of text
  tracks</span> has its <span>text track mode</span> change value, the user agent must run the
  following steps for the <span>media element</span>:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span>'s <span>pending text track change notification
   flag</span> is set, return.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>media element</span>'s <span>pending text track change notification
   flag</span>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to run these steps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Unset the <span>media element</span>'s <span>pending text track change notification
     flag</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code
     data-x="event-media-change">change</code> at the <span>media element</span>'s <code
     data-x="dom-media-textTracks">textTracks</code> attribute's <code>TextTrackList</code>
     object.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the <span>media element</span>'s <span>show poster flag</span> is not set, run the
   <i data-x="time marches on">time marches on</i> steps.</p></li>

  <hr>

  <p>A <dfn>text track cue</dfn> is the unit of time-sensitive data in a <span>text track</span>,
  corresponding for instance for subtitles and captions to the text that appears at a particular
  time and disappears at another time.</p>

  <p>Each <span>text track cue</span> consists of:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track cue identifier">An identifier</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>An arbitrary string.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track cue start time">A start time</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>The time, in seconds and fractions of a second, that describes the beginning of the range of
    the <span>media data</span> to which the cue applies.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track cue end time">An end time</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>The time, in seconds and fractions of a second, that describes the end of the range of the
    <span>media data</span> to which the cue applies.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="text track cue pause-on-exit flag">A pause-on-exit flag</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>A boolean indicating whether playback of the <span>media resource</span> is to pause when the
    end of the range to which the cue applies is reached.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Some additional format-specific data</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Additional fields, as needed for the format, including the actual data of the cue. For example, WebVTT has a <span>text track cue
    writing direction</span> and so forth. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p>
   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">The <span>text track cue start time</span> and <span>text track cue end
  time</span> can be negative. (The <span>current playback position</span> can never be negative,
  though, so cues entirely before time zero cannot be active.)</p>

  <p>Each <span>text track cue</span> has a corresponding <code>TextTrackCue</code> object (or more
  specifically, an object that inherits from <code>TextTrackCue</code> &mdash; for example, WebVTT
  cues use the <code>VTTCue</code> interface). A <span>text track cue</span>'s in-memory
  representation can be dynamically changed through this <code>TextTrackCue</code> API. <ref
  spec=WEBVTT></p>

  <p>A <span>text track cue</span> is associated with <span>rules for updating the text track
  rendering</span>, as defined by the specification for the specific kind of <span>text track
  cue</span>. These rules are used specifically when the object representing the cue is added to a
  <code>TextTrack</code> object using the <code data-x="dom-TextTrack-addCue">addCue()</code>
  method.</p>

  <p>In addition, each <span>text track cue</span> has two pieces of dynamic information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The <dfn data-x="text track cue active flag">active flag</dfn>
   <dd>

    <p>This flag must be initially unset. The flag is used to ensure events are fired appropriately
    when the cue becomes active or inactive, and to make sure the right cues are rendered.</p>

    <p>The user agent must synchronously unset this flag whenever the <span>text track cue</span> is
    removed from its <span>text track</span>'s <span>text track list of cues</span>; whenever the
    <span>text track</span> itself is removed from its <span>media element</span>'s <span>list of
    text tracks</span> or has its <span>text track mode</span> changed to <span data-x="text track
    disabled">disabled</span>; and whenever the <span>media element</span>'s <code
    data-x="dom-media-readyState">readyState</code> is changed back to <code
    data-x="dom-media-HAVE_NOTHING">HAVE_NOTHING</code>. When the flag is unset in this way for one
    or more cues in <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> that were <span data-x="text track
    showing">showing</span> prior to the relevant incident, the user agent must, after having unset
    the flag for all the affected cues, apply the <span>rules for updating the text track
    rendering</span> of those <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span>. For example, for <span
    data-x="text track">text tracks</span> based on WebVTT, the <span>rules for updating the display
    of WebVTT text tracks</span>. <ref spec=WEBVTT></p> </dd>

   <dt>The <dfn data-x="text track cue display state">display state</dfn>
   <dd>

    <p>This is used as part of the rendering model, to keep cues in a consistent position. It must
    initially be empty. Whenever the <span>text track cue active flag</span> is unset, the user
    agent must empty the <span>text track cue display state</span>.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The <span data-x="text track cue">text track cues</span> of a <span>media element</span>'s
  <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> are ordered relative to each other in the <dfn>text
  track cue order</dfn>, which is determined as follows: first group the <span data-x="text track
  cue">cues</span> by their <span>text track</span>, with the groups being sorted in the same order
  as their <span data-x="text track">text tracks</span> appear in the <span>media element</span>'s
  <span>list of text tracks</span>; then, within each group, <span data-x="text track
  cue">cues</span> must be sorted by their <span data-x="text track cue start time">start
  time</span>, earliest first; then, any <span data-x="text track cue">cues</span> with the same
  <span data-x="text track cue start time">start time</span> must be sorted by their <span
  data-x="text track cue end time">end time</span>, latest first; and finally, any <span
  data-x="text track cue">cues</span> with identical <span data-x="text track cue end time">end
  times</span> must be sorted in the order they were last added to their respective <span>text track
  list of cues</span>, oldest first (so e.g. for cues from a WebVTT file, that would initially be
  the order in which the cues were listed in the file). <ref spec=WEBVTT></p>
