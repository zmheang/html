  <h4>Conversations</h4>

  <!-- https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2009Sep/0043.html -->

  <p>This specification does not define a specific element for marking up conversations, meeting
  minutes, chat transcripts, dialogues in screenplays, instant message logs, and other situations
  where different players take turns in discourse.</p>

  <p>Instead, authors are encouraged to mark up conversations using <code>p</code> elements and
  punctuation. Authors who need to mark the speaker for styling purposes are encouraged to use
  <code>span</code> or <code>b</code>. Paragraphs with their text wrapped in the <code>i</code>
  element can be used for marking up stage directions.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This example demonstrates this using an extract from Abbot and Costello's famous sketch,
   <cite>Who's on first</cite>:</p>

<pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p> Costello: Look, you gotta first baseman?
&lt;p> Abbott: Certainly.
&lt;p> Costello: Who's playing first?
&lt;p> Abbott: That's right.
&lt;p> Costello becomes exasperated.
&lt;p> Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?
&lt;p> Abbott: Every dollar of it.</code></pre>

  </div>

   <p>The following extract shows how an IM conversation log could be marked up, using the
   <code>data</code> element to provide Unix timestamps for each line. Note that the timestamps are
   provided in a format that the <code>time</code> element does not support, so the
   <code>data</code> element is used instead (namely, Unix <code data-x="">time_t</code> timestamps).
   Had the author wished to mark up the data using one of the date and time formats supported by the
   <code>time</code> element, that element could have been used instead of <code>data</code>. This
   could be advantageous as it would allow data analysis tools to detect the timestamps
   unambiguously, without coordination with the page author.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p> &lt;data value="1319898155">14:22&lt;/data> &lt;b>egof&lt;/b> I'm not that nerdy, I've only seen 30% of the star trek episodes
&lt;p> &lt;data value="1319898192">14:23&lt;/data> &lt;b>kaj&lt;/b> if you know what percentage of the star trek episodes you have seen, you are inarguably nerdy
&lt;p> &lt;data value="1319898200">14:23&lt;/data> &lt;b>egof&lt;/b> it's unarguably
&lt;p> &lt;data value="1319898228">14:23&lt;/data> &lt;i>* kaj blinks&lt;/i>
&lt;p> &lt;data value="1319898260">14:24&lt;/data> &lt;b>kaj&lt;/b> you are not helping your case</code></pre>

   <p>HTML does not have a good way to mark up graphs, so descriptions of interactive conversations
   from games are more difficult to mark up. This example shows one possible convention using
   <code>dl</code> elements to list the possible responses at each point in the conversation.
   Another option to consider is describing the conversation in the form of a DOT file, and
   outputting the result as an SVG image to place in the document. <ref spec=DOT></p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p> Next, you meet a fisher. You can say one of several greetings:
&lt;dl>
 &lt;dt> "Hello there!"
 &lt;dd>
  &lt;p> She responds with "Hello, how may I help you?"; you can respond with:
  &lt;dl>
   &lt;dt> "I would like to buy a fish."
   &lt;dd> &lt;p> She sells you a fish and the conversation finishes.
   &lt;dt> "Can I borrow your boat?"
   &lt;dd>
    &lt;p> She is surprised and asks "What are you offering in return?".
    &lt;dl>
     &lt;dt> "Five gold." (if you have enough)
     &lt;dt> "Ten gold." (if you have enough)
     &lt;dt> "Fifteen gold." (if you have enough)
     &lt;dd> &lt;p> She lends you her boat. The conversation ends.
     &lt;dt> "A fish." (if you have one)
     &lt;dt> "A newspaper." (if you have one)
     &lt;dt> "A pebble." (if you have one)
     &lt;dd> &lt;p> "No thanks", she replies. Your conversation options
     at this point are the same as they were after asking to borrow
     her boat, minus any options you've suggested before.
    &lt;/dl>
   &lt;/dd>
  &lt;/dl>
 &lt;/dd>
 &lt;dt> "Vote for me in the next election!"
 &lt;dd> &lt;p> She turns away. The conversation finishes.
 &lt;dt> "Madam, are you aware that your fish are running away?"
 &lt;dd>
  &lt;p> She looks at you skeptically and says "Fish cannot run, miss".
  &lt;dl>
   &lt;dt> "You got me!"
   &lt;dd> &lt;p> The fisher sighs and the conversation ends.
   &lt;dt> "Only kidding."
   &lt;dd> &lt;p> "Good one!" she retorts. Your conversation options at this
   point are the same as those following "Hello there!" above.
   &lt;dt> "Oh, then what are they doing?"
   &lt;dd> &lt;p> She looks at her fish, giving you an opportunity to steal
   her boat, which you do. The conversation ends.
  &lt;/dl>
 &lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl></code></pre>

   <p>In some games, conversations are simpler: each character merely has a fixed set of lines that
   they say. In this example, a game FAQ/walkthrough lists some of the known possible responses for
   each character:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;section>
 &lt;h1>Dialogue&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>&lt;small>Some characters repeat their lines in order each time you interact
 with them, others randomly pick from amongst their lines. Those who respond in
 order have numbered entries in the lists below.&lt;/small>
 &lt;h2>The Shopkeeper&lt;/h2>
 &lt;ul>
  &lt;li>How may I help you?
  &lt;li>Fresh apples!
  &lt;li>A loaf of bread for madam?
 &lt;/ul>
 &lt;h2>The pilot&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>Before the accident:
 &lt;ul>
  &lt;li>I'm about to fly out, sorry!
  &lt;li>Sorry, I'm just waiting for flight clearance and then I'll be off!
 &lt;/ul>
 &lt;p>After the accident:
 &lt;ol>
  &lt;li>I'm about to fly out, sorry!
  &lt;li>Ok, I'm not leaving right now, my plane is being cleaned.
  &lt;li>Ok, it's not being cleaned, it needs a minor repair first.
  &lt;li>Ok, ok, stop bothering me! Truth is, I had a crash.
 &lt;/ol>
 &lt;h2>Clan Leader&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>During the first clan meeting:
 &lt;ul>
  &lt;li>Hey, have you seen my daughter? I bet she's up to something nefarious again...
  &lt;li>Nice weather we're having today, eh?
  &lt;li>The name is Bailey, Jeff Bailey. How can I help you today?
  &lt;li>A glass of water? Fresh from the well!
 &lt;/ul>
 &lt;p>After the earthquake:
 &lt;ol>
  &lt;li>Everyone is safe in the shelter, we just have to put out the fire!
  &lt;li>I'll go and tell the fire brigade, you keep hosing it down!
 &lt;/ol>
&lt;/section></code></pre>
