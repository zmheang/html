  <h5><dfn data-x="script content restrictions">Restrictions for contents of <code>script</code> elements</dfn></h5>

  <p class="note">The easiest and safest way to avoid the rather strange restrictions described in
  this section is to always escape "<code data-x="">&lt;!--</code>" as "<code
  data-x="">&lt;\!--</code>", "<code data-x="">&lt;script</code>" as "<code
  data-x="">&lt;\script</code>", and "<code data-x="">&lt;/script</code>" as "<code
  data-x="">&lt;\/script</code>" when these sequences appear in literals in scripts (e.g. in
  strings, regular expressions, or comments), and to avoid writing code that uses such constructs in
  expressions. Doing so avoids the pitfalls that the restrictions in this section are prone to
  triggering: namely, that, for historical reasons, parsing of <code>script</code> blocks in HTML is
  a strange and exotic practice that acts unintuitively in the face of these sequences.</p>

  <p>The <code>textContent</code> of a <code>script</code> element must match the <code
  data-x="">script</code> production in the following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode.
  <ref spec=ABNF></p>

  <pre>script        = outer *( comment-open inner comment-close outer )

outer         = &lt; any string that doesn't contain a substring that matches not-in-outer >
not-in-outer  = comment-open
inner         = &lt; any string that doesn't contain a substring that matches not-in-inner >
not-in-inner  = comment-close / script-open

comment-open  = "&lt;!--"
comment-close = "-->"
script-open   = "&lt;" s c r i p t tag-end

s             =  %x0053 ; U+0053 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S
s             =/ %x0073 ; U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S
c             =  %x0043 ; U+0043 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C
c             =/ %x0063 ; U+0063 LATIN SMALL LETTER C
r             =  %x0052 ; U+0052 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R
r             =/ %x0072 ; U+0072 LATIN SMALL LETTER R
i             =  %x0049 ; U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
i             =/ %x0069 ; U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I
p             =  %x0050 ; U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P
p             =/ %x0070 ; U+0070 LATIN SMALL LETTER P
t             =  %x0054 ; U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T
t             =/ %x0074 ; U+0074 LATIN SMALL LETTER T

tag-end       =  %x0009 ; U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
tag-end       =/ %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
tag-end       =/ %x000C ; U+000C FORM FEED (FF)
tag-end       =/ %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
tag-end       =/ %x002F ; U+002F SOLIDUS (/)
tag-end       =/ %x003E ; U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;)</pre>

  <p>When a <code>script</code> element contains <span>script documentation</span>, there are
  further restrictions on the contents of the element, as described in the section below.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following script illustrates this issue. Suppose you have a script that contains a string,
   as in:</p>

   <pre><code class="js" data-x="">var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script>';
console.log(example);</code></pre>

   <p>If one were to put this string directly in a <code>script</code> block, it would violate the
   restrictions above:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;script>
  var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script>';
  console.log(example);
&lt;/script></code></pre>

   <p>The bigger problem, though, and the reason why it would violate those restrictions, is that
   actually the script would get parsed weirdly: <em>the script block above is not terminated</em>.
   That is, what looks like a "<code data-x="">&lt;/script></code>" end tag in this snippet is
   actually still part of the <code>script</code> block. The script doesn't execute (since it's not
   terminated); if it somehow were to execute, as it might if the markup looked as follows, it would
   fail because the script (highlighted here) is not valid JavaScript:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;script><mark>
  var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script>';
  console.log(example);
&lt;/script>
&lt;!-- despite appearances, this is actually part of the script still! -->
&lt;script>
 ... // this is the same script block still...
</mark>&lt;/script></code></pre>

   <p>What is going on here is that for legacy reasons, "<code data-x="">&lt;!--</code>" and "<code
   data-x="">&lt;script</code>" strings in <code>script</code> elements in HTML need to be balanced
   in order for the parser to consider closing the block.</p>

   <p>By escaping the problematic strings as mentioned at the top of this section, the problem is
   avoided entirely:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;script><mark>
  // Note: `\s` is an escape sequence for `s`.
  var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;\!-- &lt;\script>';
  console.log(example);
</mark>&lt;/script>
&lt;!-- this is just a comment between script blocks -->
&lt;script><mark>
 ... // this is a new script block
</mark>&lt;/script></code></pre>

   <p>It is possible for these sequences to naturally occur in script expressions, as in the
   following examples:</p>

   <pre><code class="js" data-x="">if (x&lt;!--y) { ... }
if ( player&lt;script ) { ... }</code></pre>

   <p>In such cases the characters cannot be escaped, but the expressions can be rewritten so that
   the sequences don't occur, as in:</p>

   <pre><code class="js" data-x="">if (x &lt; !--y) { ... }
if (!--y > x) { ... }
if (!(--y) > x) { ... }
if (player &lt; script) { ... }
if (script > player) { ... }</code></pre>

   <p>Doing this also avoids a different pitfall as well: for related historical reasons, the string
   "&lt;!--" in <span data-x="classic script">classic scripts</span> is actually treated as a line
   comment start, just like "//".</p>

  </div>
