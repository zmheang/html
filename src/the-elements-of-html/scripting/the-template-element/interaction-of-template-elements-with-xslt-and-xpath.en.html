  <h5 id="template-XSLT-XPath">Interaction of <code>template</code> elements with XSLT and XPath</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification does not define how XSLT and XPath interact with the <code>template</code>
  element. However, in the absence of another specification actually defining this, here are some
  guidelines for implementers, which are intended to be consistent with other processing described
  in this specification:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>An XSLT processor based on an XML parser that acts <span data-x="xml parser">as described
   in this specification</span> needs to act as if <code>template</code> elements contain as
   descendants their <span>template contents</span> for the purposes of the transform.</p></li>

   <li><p>An XSLT processor that outputs a DOM needs to ensure that nodes that would go into a
   <code>template</code> element are instead placed into the element's <span>template
   contents</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>XPath evaluation using the XPath DOM API when applied to a <code>Document</code> parsed
   using the <span>HTML parser</span> or the <span>XML parser</span> described in this specification
   needs to ignore <span>template contents</span>.</p>

  </ul>
