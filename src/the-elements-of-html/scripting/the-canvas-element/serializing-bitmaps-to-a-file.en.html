  <div w-nodev>

  <p>When a user agent is to create <!--en-GB--><dfn id="a-serialisation-of-the-bitmap-as-a-file">a
  serialization of the bitmap as a file</dfn>, given an optional <var>type</var> and
  <var>quality</var>, it must create an image file in the format given by <var>type</var>, or if
  <var>type</var> was not supplied, in the PNG format. If an error occurs during the creation of
  the image file (e.g. an internal encoder error), then the result of the serialization is null.
  <ref spec=PNG></p>

  <p>The image file's pixel data must be the bitmap's pixel data scaled to one image pixel per
  coordinate space unit, and if the file format used supports encoding resolution metadata, the
  resolution must be given as 96dpi (one image pixel per <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixel</span>).</p>

  <p>If <var>type</var> is supplied, then it must be interpreted as a <span data-x="MIME type">MIME
  type</span> giving the format to use. If the type has any parameters, then it must be treated as
  not supported.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, the value "<code>image/png</code>" would mean to generate a PNG
  image, the value "<code>image/jpeg</code>" would mean to generate a JPEG image, and the value
  "<code>image/svg+xml</code>" would mean to generate an SVG image (which would require that the
  user agent track how the bitmap was generated, an unlikely, though potentially awesome,
  feature).</p>

  <p>User agents must support PNG ("<code>image/png</code>"). User agents may support other types.
  If the user agent does not support the requested type, then it must create the file using the PNG
  format. <ref spec=PNG></p>

  <p>User agents must <span data-x="converted to ASCII lowercase">convert the provided type to ASCII
  lowercase</span> before establishing if they support that type.</p>

  <p>For image types that do not support an alpha channel, the serialized image must be the bitmap
  image composited onto a solid black background using the source-over operator.</p>

  <p>If <var>type</var> is an image format that supports variable quality (such as
  "<code>image/jpeg</code>") and <var>quality</var> is given, then, if <span
  data-x="js-Type">Type</span>(<var>quality</var>) is Number, and <var>quality</var> is in the range
  0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, the user agent must treat <var>quality</var> as the desired quality level.
  If <span data-x="js-Type">Type</span>(<var>quality</var>) is not Number, or if <var>quality</var>
  is outside that range, the user agent must use its default quality value, as if the
  <var>quality</var> argument had not been given.</p>

  <p class="note">The use of type-testing here, instead of simply declaring <var>quality</var> as
  a Web IDL <code data-x="">double</code>, is a historical artifact.</p>
