  <h6>Best practices</h6>

  <p>When a canvas is interactive, authors should include focusable elements in the element's
  fallback content corresponding to each focusable part of the canvas, as in the <a
  href="#drawCustomFocusRingExample">example above</a>.</p>

  <p>When rendering focus rings, to ensure that focus rings have the appearance of native focus
  rings, authors should use the <code
  data-x="dom-context-2d-drawFocusIfNeeded">drawFocusIfNeeded()</code> method, passing it the
  element for which a ring is being drawn. This method only draws the focus ring if the element is
  <span>focused</span>, so that it can simply be called whenever drawing the element, without
  checking whether the element is focused or not first.</p>

  <p>In addition to drawing focus rings, authors should use the <code
  data-x="dom-context-2d-scrollPathIntoView">scrollPathIntoView()</code> method when an element in
  the canvas is focused, to make sure it is visible on the screen (if applicable).</p>

  <p id="no-text-editing-in-canvas-please">Authors should avoid implementing text editing controls
  using the <code>canvas</code> element. Doing so has a large number of disadvantages:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>Mouse placement of the caret has to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Keyboard movement of the caret has to be reimplemented (possibly across lines, for multiline
   text input).</li>

   <li>Scrolling of the text control has to be implemented (horizontally for long lines, vertically
   for multiline input).</li>

   <li>Native features such as copy-and-paste have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Native features such as spell-checking have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Native features such as drag-and-drop have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Native features such as page-wide text search have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Native features specific to the user, for example custom text services, have to be
   reimplemented. This is close to impossible since each user might have different services
   installed, and there is an unbounded set of possible such services.</li>

   <li>Bidirectional text editing has to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>For multiline text editing, line wrapping has to be implemented for all relevant
   languages.</li>

   <li>Text selection has to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Dragging of bidirectional text selections has to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Platform-native keyboard shortcuts have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Platform-native input method editors (IMEs) have to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Undo and redo functionality has to be reimplemented.</li>

   <li>Accessibility features such as magnification following the caret or selection have to be
   reimplemented.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This is a huge amount of work, and authors are most strongly encouraged to avoid doing any of
  it by instead using the <code>input</code> element, the <code>textarea</code> element, or the
  <code data-x="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code> attribute.</p>
