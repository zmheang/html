  Objects that implement the <code>CanvasUserInterface</code> interface provide the following
  methods to control drawing focus rings and scrolling paths into view.

  <hr>

  <p id="dom-context-2d-drawosfocusring">The <dfn><code
  data-x="dom-context-2d-drawFocusIfNeeded">drawFocusIfNeeded(<var>element</var>)</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>element</var> is not <span>focused</span> or is not a descendant of the element with
   whose context the method is associated, then return.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Draw a focus ring of the appropriate style along the intended path, following platform
    conventions.</p>

    <p class="note">Some platforms only draw focus rings around elements that have been focused from
    the keyboard, and not those focused from the mouse. Other platforms simply don't draw focus
    rings around some elements at all unless relevant accessibility features are enabled. This API
    is intended to follow these conventions. User agents that implement distinctions based on the
    manner in which the element was focused are encouraged to classify focus driven by the <code
    data-x="dom-focus">focus()</code> method based on the kind of user interaction event from which
    the call was triggered (if any).</p>

    <p>The focus ring should not be subject to the <span data-x="shadows">shadow effects</span>, the
    <span data-x="dom-context-2d-globalAlpha">global alpha</span>, the <span
    data-x="dom-context-2d-globalCompositeOperation">global composition operators</span>, or any of
    the members in the <code>CanvasFillStrokeStyles</code>, <code>CanvasPathDrawingStyles</code>,
    <code>CanvasTextDrawingStyles</code> interfaces, but <em>should</em> be subject to the
    <span>clipping region</span>. (The effect of transformations is described above and varies based
    on which path is being used.)</p>
   </li>

   <li><p><a href="#inform">Inform the user</a> that the focus is at the location given by the
   intended path. User agents may wait until the next time the <span>event loop</span> reaches its
   <span>update the rendering</span> step to optionally inform the user.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>User agents should not implicitly close open subpaths in the intended path when drawing the
  focus ring.</p>

  <p class="note">This might be a moot point, however. For example, if the focus ring is drawn as an
  axis-aligned bounding rectangle around the points in the intended path, then whether the subpaths
  are closed or not has no effect. This specification intentionally does not specify precisely how
  focus rings are to be drawn: user agents are expected to honor their platform's native
  conventions.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-context-2d-scrollPathIntoView">scrollPathIntoView()</code></dfn>
  method, when invoked, must run these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>specifiedRectangle</var> be the rectangle of the bounding box of the intended
   path.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>notionalChild</var> be a hypothetical element that is a rendered child of the
   <code>canvas</code> element whose dimensions are those of <var>specifiedRectangle</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="scroll an element into view">Scroll <var>notionalChild</var> into
   view</span> with <var>behavior</var> set to "auto", <var>block</var> set to "start", and
   <var>inline</var> set to "nearest".</p>

   <li><p>Optionally, <a href="#inform">inform the user</a> that the caret or selection (or both)
   cover <var>specifiedRectangle</var> of the canvas. The user agent may wait until the next time
   the <span>event loop</span> reaches its <span>update the rendering</span> step to optionally
   inform the user.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p id="inform">"Inform the user", as used in this section, does not imply any persistent state
  change. It could mean, for instance, calling a system accessibility API to notify assistive
  technologies such as magnification tools so that the user's magnifier moves to the given area of
  the canvas. However, it does not associate the path with the element, or provide a region for
  tactile feedback, etc.</p>
