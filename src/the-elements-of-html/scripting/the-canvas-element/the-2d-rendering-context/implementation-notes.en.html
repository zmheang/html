  <h6>Implementation notes</h6>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>The <span>output bitmap</span>, when it is not directly displayed by the user agent,
  implementations can, instead of updating this bitmap, merely remember the sequence of drawing
  operations that have been applied to it until such time as the bitmap's actual data is needed
  (for example because of a call to <code data-x="dom-context-2d-drawImage">drawImage()</code>, or
  the <code data-x="dom-createImageBitmap">createImageBitmap()</code> factory method). In many
  cases, this will be more memory efficient.</p>

  <p>The bitmap of a <code>canvas</code> element is the one bitmap that's pretty much always going
  to be needed in practice. The <span>output bitmap</span> of a rendering context, when it has one,
  is always just an alias to a <code>canvas</code> element's bitmap.</p>

  <p>Additional bitmaps are sometimes needed, e.g. to enable fast drawing when the canvas is being
  painted at a different size than its <span data-x="intrinsic dimensions">intrinsic size</span>,
  or to enable double buffering so that graphics updates, like page scrolling for example, can be
  processed concurrently while canvas draw commands are being executed.</p>
