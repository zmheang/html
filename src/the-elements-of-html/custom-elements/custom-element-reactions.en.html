  <h4 id="custom-element-reactions">Custom element reactions</h4>

  <p>A <span>custom element</span> possesses the ability to respond to certain occurrences by
  running author code:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>When <span data-x="custom-element-upgrades">upgraded</span>, its <span data-x="custom
   element constructor">constructor</span> is run, with no arguments.</p></li>

   <li><p>When it <span>becomes connected</span>, its <code data-x="">connectedCallback</code> is
   called, with no arguments.</p></li>

   <li><p>When it <span>becomes disconnected</span>, its <code data-x="">disconnectedCallback</code>
   is called, with no arguments.</p></li>

   <li><p>When it is <span data-x="concept-node-adopt">adopted</span> into a new document, its <code
   data-x="">adoptedCallback</code> is called, given the old document and new document as
   arguments.</p></li>

   <li><p>When any of its attributes are <span
   data-x="concept-element-attributes-change">changed</span>, <span
   data-x="concept-element-attributes-append">appended</span>, <span
   data-x="concept-element-attributes-remove">removed</span>, or <span
   data-x="concept-element-attributes-replace">replaced</span>, its <code
   data-x="">attributeChangedCallback</code> is called, given the attribute's local name, old value,
   new value, and namespace as arguments. (An attribute's old or new value is considered to be null
   when the attribute is added or removed, respectively.)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We call these reactions collectively <dfn data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom
  element reactions</dfn>.</p>

  <p>The way in which <span data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span>
  are invoked is done with special care, to avoid running author code during the middle of delicate
  operations. Effectively, they are delayed until "just before returning to user script". This means
  that for most purposes they appear to execute synchronously, but in the case of complicated
  composite operations (like <span data-x="concept-node-clone">cloning</span>, or <span
  data-x="concept-range">range</span> manipulation), they will instead be delayed until after all
  the relevant user agent processing steps have completed, and then run together as a batch.</p>

  <p><span w-nodev>Additionally, the precise ordering of these reactions is managed via a
  somewhat-complicated stack-of-queues system, described below. The intention behind this system is
  to guarantee</span><span w-dev>It is guaranteed</span> that <span
  data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span> always are invoked in the
  same order as their triggering actions, at least within the local context of a single <span>custom
  element</span>. (Because <span data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element
  reaction</span> code can perform its own mutations, it is not possible to give a global ordering
  guarantee across multiple elements.)</p>

  <p>Each <span>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</span> has a <dfn>custom element
  reactions stack</dfn>, which is initially empty. The <dfn>current element queue</dfn> is the
  <span>element queue</span> at the top of the <span>custom element reactions stack</span>. Each
  item in the stack is an <dfn>element queue</dfn>, which is initially empty as well. Each item in
  an <span>element queue</span> is an element. (The elements are not necessarily <span
  data-x="concept-element-custom">custom</span> yet, since this queue is used for <span
  data-x="custom-element-upgrades">upgrades</span> as well.)</p>

  <p>Each <span>custom element reactions stack</span> has an associated <dfn>backup element
  queue</dfn>, which an initially-empty <span>element queue</span>. Elements are pushed onto the
  <span>backup element queue</span> during operations that affect the DOM without going through an
  API decorated with <code data-x="CEReactions">[CEReactions]</code>, or through the parser's
  <span>create an element for the token</span> algorithm. An example of this is a user-initiated
  editing operation which modifies the descendants or attributes of an <span>editable</span>
  element. To prevent reentrancy when processing the <span>backup element queue</span>, each
  <span>custom element reactions stack</span> also has a <dfn>processing the backup element
  queue</dfn> flag, initially unset.</p>

  <p>All elements have an associated <dfn>custom element reaction queue</dfn>, initially empty. Each
  item in the <span>custom element reaction queue</span> is of one of two types:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>An <dfn>upgrade reaction</dfn>, which will <span
   data-x="custom-element-upgrades">upgrade</span> the custom element and contains a <span>custom
   element definition</span>; or</p></li>

   <li><p>A <dfn>callback reaction</dfn>, which will call a lifecycle callback, and contains a
   callback function as well as a list of arguments.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is all summarized in the following schematic diagram:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/custom-element-reactions.svg" style="width: 80%; max-width: 580px;" alt="A custom element reactions stack consists of a stack of element queues. Zooming in on a particular queue, we see that it contains a number of elements (in our example, &lt;x-a&gt;, then &lt;x-b&gt;, then &lt;x-c&gt;). Any particular element in the queue then has a custom element reaction queue. Zooming in on the custom element reaction queue, we see that it contains a variety of queued-up reactions (in our example, upgrade, then attribute changed, then another attribute changed, then connected)."></p>

  <p>To <dfn>enqueue an element on the appropriate element queue</dfn>, given an element
  <var>element</var>, run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>If the <span>custom element reactions stack</span> is empty, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Add <var>element</var> to the <span>backup element queue</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If the <span>processing the backup element queue</span> flag is set, then
     return.</p></li>

     <li><p>Set the <span>processing the backup element queue</span> flag.</p></li>

     <li>
      <p><span>Queue a microtask</span> to perform the following steps:</p>

       <li><p>Unset the <span>processing the backup element queue</span> flag.</p></li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, add <var>element</var> to the <span>current element queue</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>To <dfn data-export="">enqueue a custom element callback reaction</dfn>, given a <span>custom
  element</span> <var>element</var>, a callback name <var>callbackName</var>, and a list of

   <li><p>If <var>callback</var> is null, then return</p></li>

     not contain <var>attributeName</var>, then return.</p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Add a new <span>callback reaction</span> to <var>element</var>'s <span>custom element

   <var>args</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Enqueue an element on the appropriate element queue</span> given
   <var>element</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>To <dfn data-export="">enqueue a custom element upgrade reaction</dfn>, given an element
  <var>element</var> and <span>custom element definition</span> <var>definition</var>, run the
  following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Add a new <span>upgrade reaction</span> to <var>element</var>'s <span>custom element
   reaction queue</span>, with <span>custom element definition</span>
   <var>definition</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Enqueue an element on the appropriate element queue</span> given
   <var>element</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>To <dfn>invoke custom element reactions</dfn> in an <span>element queue</span>
  <var>queue</var>, run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>For each <span>custom element</span> <var>element</var> in <var>queue</var>:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>reactions</var> be <var>element</var>'s <span>custom element reaction

     <li>
      <p>Repeat until <var>reactions</var> is empty:</p>

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>Remove the first element of <var>reactions</var>, and let <var>reaction</var> be that

        </dl>

        <p>If this throws an exception, catch it, and <span>report the exception</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>To ensure <span data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span> are
  triggered appropriately, we introduce the <dfn data-export="" data-dfn-type="extended-attribute"
  data-lt="CEReactions" data-x="CEReactions"><code>[CEReactions]</code></dfn> IDL <span>extended
  attribute</span>. It indicates that the relevant algorithm is to be supplemented with additional
  steps in order to appropriately track and invoke <span
  data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="CEReactions">[CEReactions]</code> extended attribute must take no
  arguments, and must not appear on anything other than an operation, attribute, setter, or deleter.
  Additionally, it must not appear on readonly attributes.</p>

  <p>Operations, attributes, setters, or deleters annotated with the <code
  data-x="CEReactions">[CEReactions]</code> extended attribute must run the following steps in place
  of the ones specified in their description:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p><span data-x="stack push">Push</span> a new <span>element queue</span> onto the
   <span>custom element reactions stack</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run the originally-specified steps for this construct, catching any exceptions. If the
   steps return a value, let <var>value</var> be the returned value. If they throw an exception, let
   <var>exception</var> be the thrown exception.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>queue</var> be the result of <span data-x="stack pop">popping</span> from the
   <span>custom element reactions stack</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Invoke custom element reactions</span> in <var>queue</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If an exception <var>exception</var> was thrown by the original steps, rethrow
   <var>exception</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If a value <var>value</var> was returned from the original steps, return
   <var>value</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note">
   <p>The intent behind this extended attribute is somewhat subtle. One way of accomplishing its
   goals would be to say that every operation, attribute, setter, and deleter on the platform
   <!--non-normative-->must have these steps inserted, and to allow implementers to optimize away
   unnecessary cases (where no DOM mutation is possible that could cause <span
   data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span> to occur).</p>

   <p>However, in practice this imprecision could lead to non-interoperable implementations of <span
   data-x="concept-custom-element-reaction">custom element reactions</span>, as some implementations
   might forget to invoke these steps in some cases. Instead, we settled on the approach of
   explicitly annotating all relevant IDL constructs, as a way of ensuring interoperable behavior
   and helping implementations easily pinpoint all cases where these steps are necessary.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Any nonstandard APIs introduced by the user agent that could modify the DOM in such a way as to
  cause <span data-x="enqueue a custom element callback reaction">enqueuing a custom element
  callback reaction</span> or <span data-x="enqueue a custom element upgrade reaction">enqueuing a
  custom element upgrade reaction</span>, for example by modifying any attributes or child elements,
  must also be decorated with the <code data-x="CEReactions">[CEReactions]</code> attribute.</p>

  <div class="note">
   <p>As of the time of this writing, the following nonstandard or not-yet-standardized APIs are
   known to fall into this category:</p>

   <ul>
    <li><p><code>HTMLElement</code>'s <code data-x="">outerText</code> IDL attribute</p></li>

    <li><p><code>HTMLInputElement</code>'s <code data-x="">webkitdirectory</code> and <code
    data-x="">incremental</code> IDL attributes</p></li>

    <li><p><code>HTMLLinkElement</code>'s <code data-x="">disabled</code> and <code
