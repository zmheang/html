  <p>The <code>em</code> element <span>represents</span> stress emphasis of its contents.</p>

  <p>The level of stress that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor
  <code>em</code> elements.</p>

  <p>The placement of stress emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence. The element thus forms an
  integral part of the content. The precise way in which stress is used in this way depends on the
  language.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>These examples show how changing the stress emphasis changes the meaning. First, a general
   statement of fact, with no stress:</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>Cats are cute animals.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>By emphasizing the first word, the statement implies that the kind of animal under discussion
   is in question (maybe someone is asserting that dogs are cute):</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats&lt;/em> are cute animals.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>Moving the stress to the verb, one highlights that the truth of the entire sentence is in
   question (maybe someone is saying cats are not cute):</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>Cats &lt;em>are&lt;/em> cute animals.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats is reasserted (maybe someone
   suggested cats were <em>mean</em> animals):</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables, someone correcting this might
   emphasize the last word:</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>Cats are cute &lt;em>animals&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>By emphasizing the entire sentence, it becomes clear that the speaker is fighting hard to get
   the point across. This kind of stress emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the
   exclamation mark here.</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are cute animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></code></pre>

   <p>Anger mixed with emphasizing the cuteness could lead to markup such as:</p>

   <pre><code class="html">&lt;p>&lt;em>Cats are &lt;em>cute&lt;/em> animals!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></code></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="note">

   <p>The <code>em</code> element isn't a generic "italics" element. Sometimes, text is intended to
   stand out from the rest of the paragraph, as if it was in a different mood or voice. For this,
   the <code>i</code> element is more appropriate.</p>

   <p>The <code>em</code> element also isn't intended to convey importance; for that purpose, the
   <code>strong</code> element is more appropriate.</p>

   <!--

    Thus the following is a bad use of <em>:

      <p><em>Note</em>: ...</p>

    You should use <strong> or <i> for this instead (depending on
    exactly what you're doing).
