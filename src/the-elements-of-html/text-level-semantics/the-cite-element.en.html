  <p>The <code>cite</code> element <span>represents</span> the title of a work (e.g.
    a book,
    a paper,
    an essay,
    a poem,
    a score,
    a song,
    a script,
    a film,
    a TV show,
    a game,
    a sculpture,
    a painting,
    a theatre production,
    a play,
    an opera,
    a musical,
    an exhibition,
    a legal case report,
    a computer program, <!-- "a software package" ? -->
  etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can
  just be a work that is mentioned in passing.</p>

  <p>A person's name is not the title of a work &mdash; even if people call that person a piece of
  work &mdash; and the element must therefore not be used to mark up people's names. (In some cases,
  the <code>b</code> element might be appropriate for names; e.g. in a gossip article where the
  names of famous people are keywords rendered with a different style to draw attention to them. In
  other cases, if an element is <em>really</em> needed, the <code>span</code> element can be
  used.)</p>

<!--(some people argue a ship is a work)
  <p>A ship is similarly not a work, and the element must not be used to mark up ship names (the
  <code>i</code> element can be used for that purpose).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This next example shows a typical use of the <code>cite</code> element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>My favorite book is &lt;cite>The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite> by
Peter F. Hamilton. My favorite comic is &lt;cite>Pearls Before
Swine&lt;/cite> by Stephan Pastis. My favorite track is &lt;cite>Jive
Samba&lt;/cite> by the Cannonball Adderley Sextet.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This is correct usage:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>According to the Wikipedia article &lt;cite>HTML&lt;/cite>, as it
stood in mid-February 2008, leaving attribute values unquoted is
unsafe. This is obviously an over-simplification.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>The following, however, is incorrect usage, as the <code>cite</code> element here is
   containing far more than the title of the work:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- do not copy this example, it is an example of bad usage! -->
&lt;p>According to &lt;cite>the Wikipedia article on HTML&lt;/cite>, as it
stood in mid-February 2008, leaving attribute values unquoted is
unsafe. This is obviously an over-simplification.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The <code>cite</code> element is obviously a key part of any citation in a bibliography, but
   it is only used to mark the title:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/cite>, United Nations,
December 1948. Adopted by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III).&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">A <em>citation</em> is not a <em>quote</em> (for which the <code>q</code> element
  is appropriate).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>This is incorrect usage, because <code>cite</code> is not for quotes:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;p>&lt;cite>This is wrong!&lt;/cite>, said Ian.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This is also incorrect usage, because a person is not a work:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;p>&lt;q>This is still wrong!&lt;/q>, said &lt;cite>Ian&lt;/cite>.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>The correct usage does not use a <code>cite</code> element:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>&lt;q>This is correct&lt;/q>, said Ian.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>As mentioned above, the <code>b</code> element might be relevant for marking names as being
   keywords in certain kinds of documents:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>And then &lt;b>Ian&lt;/b> said &lt;q>this might be right, in a
gossip column, maybe!&lt;/q>.&lt;/p></pre>
