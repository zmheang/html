  <h6>The <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code> attribute</h6>

  <!-- if more text control types start supporting multiple="", this will need to be refactored -->

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code></dfn> attribute specifies a regular
  expression against which the control's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>, or, when the
  <code data-x="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code> attribute <span
  data-x="concept-input-apply">applies</span> and is set, the control's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-values">values</span>, are to be checked.</p>

  <p>If specified, the attribute's value must match the JavaScript <i
  data-x="js-prod-Pattern">Pattern</i> production.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>If an <code>input</code> element has a <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute specified, and the attribute's value, when compiled as a JavaScript regular expression
  with only the "<code data-x="">u</code>" flag specified, compiles successfully, then the resulting regular expression is the element's
  <dfn>compiled pattern regular expression</dfn>. If the element has no such attribute, or if the
  value doesn't compile successfully, then the element has no <span>compiled pattern regular
  expression</span>. <ref spec=JAVASCRIPT></p>

  <p class="note">If the value doesn't compile successfully, user agents are encouraged to log this
  fact in a developer console, to aid debugging.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> is not the empty string, and either the element's <code
  data-x="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is not specified or it <span data-x="do not
  apply">does not apply</span> to the <code>input</code> element given its <code
  data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute's current state, and the element has a
  <span>compiled pattern regular expression</span> but that regular expression does not match the
  entirety of the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>, then the element is
  <span>suffering from a pattern mismatch</span>.</p>

  <p><strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span> is not the empty string, and the element's <code
  data-x="attr-input-multiple">multiple</code> attribute is specified and <span
  data-x="concept-input-apply">applies</span> to the <code>input</code> element, and the element has
  a <span>compiled pattern regular expression</span> but that regular expression does not match the
  entirety of each of the element's <span data-x="concept-fe-values">values</span>, then the
  element is <span>suffering from a pattern mismatch</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>compiled pattern regular expression</span>, when matched against a string, must have
  its start anchored to the start of the string and its end anchored to the end of the string.</p>

  <p class="note">This implies that the regular expression language used for this attribute is the
  same as that used in JavaScript, except that the <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute is matched against the entire value, not just any subset (somewhat as if it implied a
  <code data-x="">^(?:</code> at the start of the pattern and a <code data-x="">)$</code> at the
  end).</p>

  </div>

  <p>When an <code>input</code> element has a <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attribute specified, authors should include a <dfn><code data-x="attr-input-title">title</code></dfn> attribute to give a description of the pattern.
  User agents may use the contents of this attribute, if it is present, when informing the user that
  the pattern is not matched, or at any other suitable time, such as in a tooltip or read out by
  assistive technology when the control <span>gains focus</span>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following snippet:</p>
   <pre>&lt;label&gt; Part number:
 &lt;input pattern="[0-9][A-Z]{3}" name="part"
        title="A part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters."/&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;</pre>
   <p>...could cause the UA to display an alert such as:</p>
   <pre><samp>A part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters.
You cannot submit this form when the field is incorrect.</samp></pre>
  </div>

  <p>When a control has a <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code> attribute, the <code
  data-x="attr-input-title">title</code> attribute, if used, must describe the pattern. Additional
  information could also be included, so long as it assists the user in filling in the control.
  Otherwise, assistive technology would be impaired.</p>

  <p class="example">For instance, if the title attribute contained the caption of the control,
  assistive technology could end up saying something like <samp>The text you have entered does not
  match the required pattern. Birthday</samp>, which is not useful.</p>

  <p>UAs may still show the <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> in non-error situations (for
  example, as a tooltip when hovering over the control), so authors should be careful not to word
  <code data-x="attr-input-title">title</code>s as if an error has necessarily occurred.</p>
