  <h5 id="input-author-notes">Date, time, and number formats</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>In this pizza delivery example, the times are specified in the format "HH:MM": two digits for
  the hour, in 24-hour format, and two digits for the time. (Seconds could also be specified, though
  they are not necessary in this example.)</p>

  <p>In some locales, however, times are often expressed differently when presented to users. For
  example, in the United States, it is still common to use the 12-hour clock with an am/pm
  indicator, as in "2pm". In France, it is common to separate the hours from the minutes using an
  "h" character, as in "14h00".</p>

  <p>Similar issues exist with dates, with the added complication that even the order of the
  components is not always consistent &mdash; for example, in Cyprus the first of February 2003
  would typically be written "1/2/03", while that same date in Japan would typically be written as
  "2003&#x5E74;02&#x6708;01&#x65E5;" &mdash; and even with numbers, where locales differ, for
  example, in what punctuation is used as the decimal separator and the thousands separator.</p>

  <p>It is therefore important to distinguish the time, date, and number formats used in HTML and in
  form submissions, which are always the formats defined in this specification (and based on the
  well-established ISO 8601 standard for computer-readable date and time formats), from the time,
  date, and number formats presented to the user by the browser and accepted as input from the user
  by the browser.</p>

  <p>The format used "on the wire", i.e. in HTML markup and in form submissions, is intended to be
  computer-readable and consistent irrespective of the user's locale. Dates, for instance, are
  always written in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", as in "2003-02-01". Users are not expected to ever see
  this format.</p>

  <p>The time, date, or number given by the page in the wire format is then translated to the user's
  preferred presentation (based on user preferences or on the locale of the page itself), before
  being displayed to the user. Similarly, after the user inputs a time, date, or number using their
  preferred format, the user agent converts it back to the wire format before putting it in the DOM
  or submitting it.</p>

  <p>This allows scripts in pages and on servers to process times, dates, and numbers in a
  consistent manner without needing to support dozens of different formats, while still supporting
  the users' needs.</p>
