  <p id="security-0">Servers should not rely on client-side validation. Client-side validation can
  be intentionally bypassed by hostile users, and unintentionally bypassed by users of older user
  agents or automated tools that do not implement these features. The constraint validation features
  are only intended to improve the user experience, not to provide any kind of security
  mechanism.</p>
