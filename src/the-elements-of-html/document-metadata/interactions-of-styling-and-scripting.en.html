  <h4>Interactions of styling and scripting</h4>

  <p>Style sheets, whether added by a <code>link</code> element, a <code>style</code> element, an
  <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> PI, an HTTP `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>` header, or
  some other mechanism, have a <dfn>style sheet ready</dfn> flag, which is initially unset.</p>

  <p>When a style sheet is ready to be applied, its <span>style sheet ready</span> flag must be set.
  If the style sheet referenced no other resources (e.g. it was an internal style sheet given by a
  <code>style</code> element with no <code data-x="">@import</code> rules), then the style rules must
  be <span>immediately</span> made available to script; otherwise, the style rules must only be made available
  to script once the <span>event loop</span> reaches its <span>update the rendering</span> step.</p>

  <p>A style sheet in the context of the <code>Document</code> of an <span>HTML parser</span> or
  <span>XML parser</span> is said to be <dfn>a style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if all of
  the following conditions occur:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>The element was created by that <code>Document</code>'s parser.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element is either a <code>style</code> element or a <code>link</code> element that was
   an <span data-x="rel-stylesheet">external resource link that contributes to the styling
   processing model</span> when the element was created by the parser.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the element is a <code>link</code> element, it's <code
   data-x="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute's value <span>matches the
   environment</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's style sheet was enabled when the element was created by the parser.</p></li>

   <li><p>The element's <span>style sheet ready</span> flag is not yet set.</p></li>

   <li><p>The last time the <span>event loop</span> reached <a href="#step1">step 1</a>, the
   element's <span>root</span> was that <code>Document</code>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The user agent hasn't given up on that particular style sheet yet. A user agent may give
   up on a style sheet at any time.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Giving up on a style sheet before the style sheet loads, if the style sheet
  eventually does still load, means that the script might end up operating with incorrect
  information. For example, if a style sheet sets the color of an element to green, but a script
  that inspects the resulting style is executed before the sheet is loaded, the script will find
  that the element is black (or whatever the default color is), and might thus make poor choices
  (e.g. deciding to use black as the color elsewhere on the page, instead of green). Implementors
  have to balance the likelihood of a script using incorrect information with the performance impact
  of doing nothing while waiting for a slow network request to finish.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has a style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if there is
  either <span>a style sheet that is blocking scripts</span> in the context of that
  <code>Document</code>, or if that <code>Document</code> has a <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> that has a <span>parent browsing
  context</span>, and the <span>active document</span> of that <span>parent browsing context</span>
  itself <span>has a style sheet that is blocking scripts</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has no style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if it does not
  <span data-x="has a style sheet that is blocking scripts">have a style sheet that is blocking
  scripts</span> as defined in the previous paragraph.</p>
