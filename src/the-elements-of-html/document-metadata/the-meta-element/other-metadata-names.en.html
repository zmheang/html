  <h5>Other metadata names</h5>

  <p><dfn data-x="concept-meta-extensions">Extensions to the predefined set of metadata names</dfn>
  may be registered in the <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions">WHATWG Wiki
  MetaExtensions page</a>. <ref spec=WHATWGWIKI></p>

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page at any time to add a type. These new
  names must be specified with the following information:</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd><p>The actual name being defined. The name should not be confusingly similar to any other
   defined name (e.g. differing only in case).</p></dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short non-normative description of what the metadata name's meaning is, including the
   format the value is required to be in.</p></dd>


   <dt>Specification</dt>

   <dd>A link to a more detailed description of the metadata name's semantics and requirements. It
   could be another page on the Wiki, or a link to an external page.</dd>


   <dt>Synonyms</dt>

   <dd><p>A list of other names that have exactly the same processing requirements. Authors should
   not use the names defined to be synonyms, they are only intended to allow user agents to support
   legacy content. Anyone may remove synonyms that are not used in practice; only names that need to
   be processed as synonyms for compatibility with legacy content are to be registered in this
   way.</p></dd>


   <dt>Status</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>

     <dt>Proposed</dt>

     <dd>The name has not received wide peer review and approval. Someone has proposed it and is, or
     soon will be, using it.</dd>

     <dt>Ratified</dt>

     <dd>The name has received wide peer review and approval. It has a specification that
     unambiguously defines how to handle pages that use the name, including when they use it in
     incorrect ways.</dd>

     <dt>Discontinued</dt>

     <dd>The metadata name has received wide peer review and it has been found wanting. Existing
     pages are using this metadata name, but new pages should avoid it. The "brief description" and
     "specification" entries will give details of what authors should use instead, if anything.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>If a metadata name is found to be redundant with existing values, it should be removed and
    listed as a synonym for the existing value.</p>

    <p>If a metadata name is registered in the "proposed" state for a period of a month or more
    without being used or specified, then it may be removed from the registry.</p>

    <p>If a metadata name is added with the "proposed" status and found to be redundant with
    existing values, it should be removed and listed as a synonym for the existing value. If a
    metadata name is added with the "proposed" status and found to be harmful, then it should be
    changed to "discontinued" status.</p>

    <p>Anyone can change the status at any time, but should only do so in accordance with the
    definitions above.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Conformance checkers must use the information given on the WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page to
  establish if a value is allowed or not: values defined in this specification or marked as
  "proposed" or "ratified" must be accepted, whereas values marked as "discontinued" or not listed
  in either this specification or on the aforementioned page must be rejected as invalid.
  Conformance checkers may cache this information (e.g. for performance reasons or to avoid the use
  of unreliable network connectivity).</p>

  <p>When an author uses a new metadata name not defined by either this specification or the Wiki
  page, conformance checkers should offer to add the value to the Wiki, with the details described
  above, with the "proposed" status.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Metadata names whose values are to be <span data-x="URL">URLs</span> must not be proposed or
  accepted. Links must be represented using the <code>link</code> element, not the <code>meta</code>
  element.</p>
