  <h5>Article or section?</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>A <code>section</code> forms part of something else. An <code>article</code> is its own thing.
  But how does one know which is which? Mostly the real answer is "it depends on author intent".</p>

  <p>For example, one could imagine a book with a "Granny Smith" chapter that just said "These
  juicy, green apples make a great filling for apple pies."; that would be a <code>section</code>
  because there'd be lots of other chapters on (maybe) other kinds of apples.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, one could imagine a tweet or reddit comment or tumblr post or newspaper
  classified ad that just said "Granny Smith. These juicy, green apples make a great filling for
  apple pies."; it would then be <code>article</code>s because that was the whole thing.</p>

  <p>A comment on an article is not part of the <code>article</code> on which it is commenting,
  therefore it is its own <code>article</code>.</p>
