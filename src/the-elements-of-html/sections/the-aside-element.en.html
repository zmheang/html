  <p>The <code>aside</code> element <span>represents</span> a section of a page that consists of
  content that is tangentially related to the content around the <code>aside</code> element, and
  which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as
  sidebars in printed typography.</p>

  <p>The element can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for
  advertising, for groups of <code>nav</code> elements, and for other content that is considered
  separate from the main content of the page.</p>

  <p class="note">It's not appropriate to use the <code>aside</code> element just for
  parentheticals, since those are part of the main flow of the document.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows how an aside is used to mark up background material on Switzerland
   in a much longer news story on Europe.</p>

   <pre>&lt;aside>
 &lt;h1>Switzerland&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>Switzerland, a land-locked country in the middle of geographic
 Europe, has not joined the geopolitical European Union, though it is
 a signatory to a number of European treaties.&lt;/p>
&lt;/aside></pre>

   <p>The following example shows how an aside is used to mark up a pull quote in a longer
   article.</p>

   <pre>...

&lt;p>He later joined a large company, continuing on the same work.
&lt;q>I love my job. People ask me what I do for fun when I'm not at
work. But I'm paid to do my hobby, so I never know what to
answer. Some people wonder what they would do if they didn't have to
work... but I know what I would do, because I was unemployed for a
year, and I filled that time doing exactly what I do now.&lt;/q>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Of course his work &mdash; or should that be hobby? &mdash;
isn't his only passion. He also enjoys other pleasures.&lt;/p>

   <p>The following extract shows how <code>aside</code> can be used for blogrolls and other side
   content on a blog:</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;header>
  &lt;h1>My wonderful blog&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>My tagline&lt;/p>
 &lt;/header>
 &lt;aside>
  &lt;!-- <em>this aside contains two sections that are tangentially related
  to the page, namely, links to other blogs, and links to blog posts
  from this blog</em> -->
  &lt;nav>
   &lt;h1>My blogroll&lt;/h1>
   &lt;ul>
    &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.example.com/">Example Blog&lt;/a>

   &lt;!-- <em>this aside is about the blog post, since it's inside the

   &lt;h1>Posting&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p>While I'm thinking about it, I wanted to say something about
