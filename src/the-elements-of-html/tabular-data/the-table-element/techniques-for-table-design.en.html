  <h5 id="table-layout-techniques">Techniques for table design</h5>

  <p>Good table design is key to making tables more readable and usable.</p>

  <p>In visual media, providing column and row borders and alternating row backgrounds can be very
  effective to make complicated tables more readable.</p>

  <p>For tables with large volumes of numeric content, using monospaced fonts can help users see
  patterns, especially in situations where a user agent does not render the borders. (Unfortunately,
  for historical reasons, not rendering borders on tables is a common default.)</p>

  <p>In speech media, table cells can be distinguished by reporting the corresponding headers before
  reading the cell's contents, and by allowing users to navigate the table in a grid fashion, rather
  than serializing the entire contents of the table in source order.</p>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to use CSS to achieve these effects.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to render tables using these techniques whenever the page does not
  use CSS and the table is not classified as a layout table.</p>

  </div>
