  <h5>Link type "<dfn><code data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code> keyword may be used with
  <code>link</code> elements. This keyword creates an <span data-x="external resource link">external
  resource link</span>. This keyword is <span>body-ok</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code> keyword indicates that preemptively
  performing DNS resolution for the <span>origin</span> of the specified resource is likely to be
  beneficial, as it is highly likely that the user will require resources located at that
  <span>origin</span>, and the user experience would be improved by preempting the latency costs
  associated with DNS resolution. <span w-nodev>User agents must implement the processing model of
  the <code data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code> keyword described in <cite>Resource
  Hints</cite>.</span> <ref spec=RESOURCEHINTS></p>

  <p>There is no default type for resources given by the <code
  data-x="rel-dns-prefetch">dns-prefetch</code> keyword.</p>
