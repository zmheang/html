  <h5>Link type "<dfn><code data-x="rel-nofollow">nofollow</code></dfn>"</h5>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-nofollow">nofollow</code> keyword may be used with <code>a</code> and
  <code>area</code> elements. This keyword does not create a <span>hyperlink</span>, but <span
  data-x="hyperlink annotation">annotates</span> any other hyperlinks created by the element (the
  implied hyperlink, if no other keywords create one).</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="rel-nofollow">nofollow</code> keyword indicates that the link is not endorsed
  by the original author or publisher of the page, or that the link to the referenced document was
  included primarily because of a commercial relationship between people affiliated with the two
  pages.</p>
