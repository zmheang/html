  <p>The <code>hr</code> element <span>represents</span> a <span>paragraph</span>-level thematic
  break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a
  reference book.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following fictional extract from a project manual shows two sections that use the
   <code>hr</code> element to separate topics within the section.</p>

   <pre>&lt;section>
 &lt;h1>Communication&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>There are various methods of communication. This section
 covers a few of the important ones used by the project.&lt;/p>
 <strong>&lt;hr></strong>
 &lt;p>Communication stones seem to come in pairs and have mysterious
 properties:&lt;/p>
 &lt;ul>
  &lt;li>They can transfer thoughts in two directions once activated
  if used alone.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>If used with another device, they can transfer one's
  consciousness to another body.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>If both stones are used with another device, the
  consciousnesses switch bodies.&lt;/li>
 &lt;/ul>
 <strong>&lt;hr></strong>
 &lt;p>Radios use the electromagnetic spectrum in the meter range and
 longer.&lt;/p>
 <strong>&lt;hr></strong>
 &lt;p>Signal flares use the electromagnetic spectrum in the
 nanometer range.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>
&lt;section>
 &lt;h1>Food&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>All food at the project is rationed:&lt;/p>
 &lt;dl>
  &lt;dt>Potatoes&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>Two per day&lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>Soup&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>One bowl per day&lt;/dd>
 &lt;/dl>
 <strong>&lt;hr></strong>
 &lt;p>Cooking is done by the chefs on a set rotation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></pre>

   <p>There is no need for an <code>hr</code> element between the sections themselves, since the
   <code>section</code> elements and the <code>h1</code> elements imply thematic changes
   themselves.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following extract from <cite>Pandora's Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two
   paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it. The scene change,
   represented in the printed book by a gap containing a solitary centered star between the second
   and third paragraphs, is here represented using the <code>hr</code> element.</p>

   <pre lang="en-GB">&lt;p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching
time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical
age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading
campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a
supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwealth could be
appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Maybe it won't be that bad&lt;/i>, he told himself. The lie was
comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night's
shift.&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;hr></strong>
&lt;p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the
astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of
doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a
semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a
thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and
deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the
observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow
of Gralmond's winters.&lt;/p></pre>

  <p class="note">The <code>hr</code> element does not affect the document's
  <span>outline</span>.</p>
