  <p>The <code>figure</code> element <span>represents</span> some <span>flow content</span>,
  optionally with a caption, that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically
  <span>referenced</span> as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>

  <p class="note">"Self-contained" in this context does not necessarily mean independent. For
  example, each sentence in a paragraph is self-contained; an image that is part of a sentence would
  be inappropriate for <code>figure</code>, but an entire sentence made of images would be
  fitting.</p>

  <p>The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings,
  etc.</p>

  <div class="note" id="figure-note-about-references">
   <p>When a <code>figure</code> is referred to from the main content of the document by identifying
   it by its caption (e.g., by figure number), it enables such content to be easily moved away from
   that primary content, e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix,
   without affecting the flow of the document.</p>

   <p>If a <code>figure</code> element is <span>referenced</span> by its relative position, e.g.,
   "in the photograph above" or "as the next figure shows", then moving the figure would disrupt the
   page's meaning. Authors are encouraged to consider using labels to refer to figures, rather than
   using such relative references, so that the page can easily be restyled without affecting the
   page's meaning.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <span w-nodev>first</span> <code>figcaption</code> element child of the element, if any,
  represents the caption of the <code>figure</code> element's contents. If there is no child
  <code>figcaption</code> element, then there is no caption.</p>

  <p>A <code>figure</code> element's contents are part of the surrounding flow. If the purpose of
  the page is to display the figure, for example a photograph on an image sharing site, the
  <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> elements can be used to explicitly provide a
  caption for that figure. For content that is only tangentially related, or that serves a separate
  purpose than the surrounding flow, the <code>aside</code> element should be used (and can itself
  wrap a <code>figure</code>). For example, a pull quote that repeats content from an
  <code>article</code> would be more appropriate in an <code>aside</code> than in a
  <code>figure</code>, because it isn't part of the content, it's a repetition of the content for
  the purposes of enticing readers or highlighting key topics.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>This example shows the <code>figure</code> element to mark up a code listing.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p>In &lt;a href="#l4">listing 4&lt;/a> we see the primary core interface
API declaration.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="l4">
 &lt;figcaption>Listing 4. The primary core interface API declaration.&lt;/figcaption>
 &lt;pre>&lt;code>interface PrimaryCore {
 boolean verifyDataLine();
 void sendData(in sequence&amp;lt;byte> data);
 void initSelfDestruct();
}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The API is designed to use UTF-8.&lt;/p></code></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Here we see a <code>figure</code> element to mark up a photo that is the main content of the
   page (as in a gallery).</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lt;html lang="en">
&lt;title>Bubbles at work &mdash; My Gallery&trade;&lt;/title>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In this example, we see an image that is <em>not</em> a figure, as well as an image and a
   video that are. The first image is literally part of the example's second sentence, so it's not a
   self-contained unit, and thus <code>figure</code> would be inappropriate.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;h2>Malinko's comics&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This case centered on some sort of "intellectual property"
infringement related to a comic (see Exhibit A). The suit started
after a trailer ending with these words:

&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;img src="promblem-packed-action.png" alt="ROUGH COPY! Promblem-Packed Action!">
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>...was aired. A lawyer, armed with a Bigger Notebook, launched a
preemptive strike using snowballs. A complete copy of the trailer is
included with Exhibit B.

 &lt;video src="ex-b.mov">&lt;/video>
 &lt;figcaption>Exhibit B. The &lt;cite>Rough Copy&lt;/cite> trailer.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>The case was resolved out of court.</code></pre>

   <p>Here, a part of a poem is marked up using <code>figure</code>.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>In this example, which could be part of a much larger work discussing a castle, nested
   <code>figure</code> elements are used to provide both a group caption and individual captions for
   each figure in the group:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;figure>
 &lt;figcaption>The castle through the ages: 1423, 1858, and 1999 respectively.&lt;/figcaption>
 &lt;figure>
  &lt;figcaption>Etching. Anonymous, ca. 1423.&lt;/figcaption>
  &lt;img src="castle1423.jpeg" alt="The castle has one tower, and a tall wall around it.">
 &lt;/figure>
 &lt;figure>
  &lt;figcaption>Oil-based paint on canvas. Maria Towle, 1858.&lt;/figcaption>
  &lt;img src="castle1858.jpeg" alt="The castle now has two towers and two walls.">
 &lt;/figure>
 &lt;figure>
  &lt;figcaption>Film photograph. Peter Jankle, 1999.&lt;/figcaption>
  &lt;img src="castle1999.jpeg" alt="The castle lies in ruins, the original tower all that remains in one piece.">
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/figure></code></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The previous example could also be more succinctly written as follows (using <code
   data-x="attr-title">title</code> attributes in place of the nested
   <code>figure</code>/<code>figcaption</code> pairs):</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;figure>
 &lt;img src="castle1423.jpeg" title="Etching. Anonymous, ca. 1423."
      alt="The castle has one tower, and a tall wall around it.">
 &lt;img src="castle1858.jpeg" title="Oil-based paint on canvas. Maria Towle, 1858."
      alt="The castle now has two towers and two walls.">
 &lt;img src="castle1999.jpeg" title="Film photograph. Peter Jankle, 1999."
      alt="The castle lies in ruins, the original tower all that remains in one piece.">
 &lt;figcaption>The castle through the ages: 1423, 1858, and 1999 respectively.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></code></pre>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The figure is sometimes <span>referenced</span> only implicitly from the content:</p>
