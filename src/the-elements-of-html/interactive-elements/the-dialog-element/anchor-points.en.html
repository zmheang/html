  <h5>Anchor points</h5>

  <p class="critical">This section will eventually be moved to a CSS specification; it is specified
  here only on an interim basis until an editor can be found to own this.</p>

  <table class="css-property">
   <caption><dfn>'anchor-point'</dfn></caption>
   <tr>
    <th>Value:
    <td> none | <span>&lt;position></span>
   <tr>
    <th>Initial:
    <td> none
   <tr>
    <th>Applies to:
    <td> all elements
   <tr>
    <th>Inherited:
    <td> no
   <tr>
    <th>Percentages:
    <td> refer to width or height of box; see prose
   <tr>
    <th>Media:
    <td> visual
   <tr>
    <th>Computed value:
    <td> The <span>specified value</span>, but with any lengths replaced by their corresponding absolute length
   <tr>
    <th>Animatable:
    <td> no
   <tr>
    <th>Canonical order:
    <td> per grammar
  </table>

  <p>The <span>'anchor-point'</span> property specifies a point to which dialog boxes are to be
  aligned.</p>

  <p>If the value is a <span>&lt;position></span>, the anchor point is the point given by the value,
  which must be interpreted relative to the element's first rendered box's <span>margin box</span>.
  Percentages must be calculated relative to the element's first rendered box's <span>margin
  box</span> (specifically, its width for the horizontal position and its height for the vertical
  position). <ref spec=CSSVALUES> <ref spec=CSS></p>

  <p>If the value is the keyword 'none', then no explicit anchor point is defined. The user agent
  will pick an anchor point automatically if necessary (as described in the definition of the
  <code data-x="dom-dialog-open">open()</code> method above).</p>
