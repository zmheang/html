  <h4><dfn>Content models</dfn></h4>

  <p>Each element defined in this specification has a content model: a description of the element's
  expected <span data-x="concept-html-contents">contents</span>. An <span data-x="HTML elements">HTML
  element</span> must have contents that match the requirements described in the element's content
  model. The <dfn data-x="concept-html-contents">contents</dfn> of an element are its children in the
  DOM.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="space character">space characters</span> are always allowed between elements.
  User agents represent these characters between elements in the source markup as <code>Text</code>
  nodes in the DOM.<!-- not a conf criteria since the parser now requires this --> Empty
  <code>Text</code> nodes and <code>Text</code> nodes consisting of just sequences of those
  characters are considered <dfn>inter-element whitespace</dfn>.</p>

  <p><span>Inter-element whitespace</span>, comment nodes, and processing instruction nodes must be
  ignored when establishing whether an element's contents match the element's content model or not,
  and must be ignored when following algorithms that define document and element semantics.</p>

  <p class="note">Thus, an element <var>A</var> is said to be <i>preceded or followed</i>
  by a second element <var>B</var> if <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have
  the same parent node and there are no other element nodes or <code>Text</code> nodes (other than
  <span>inter-element whitespace</span>) between them. Similarly, a node is the <i>only child</i> of
  an element if that element contains no other nodes other than <span>inter-element
  whitespace</span>, comment nodes, and processing instruction nodes.</p>

  <p>Authors must not use <span>HTML elements</span> anywhere except where they are explicitly
  allowed, as defined for each element, or as explicitly required by other specifications. For XML
  compound documents, these contexts could be inside elements from other namespaces, if those
  elements are defined as providing the relevant contexts.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>For example, the Atom specification defines a <code data-x="">content</code> element. When its
   <code data-x="">type</code> attribute has the value <code data-x="">xhtml</code>, the Atom
   specification requires that it contain a single HTML <code>div</code> element. Thus, a
   <code>div</code> element is allowed in that context, even though this is not explicitly
   normatively stated by this specification. <ref spec=ATOM></p>
  </div>

  <p>In addition, <span>HTML elements</span> may be orphan nodes (i.e. without a parent node).</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, creating a <code>td</code> element and storing it in a global variable in a
   script is conforming, even though <code>td</code> elements are otherwise only supposed to be used
   inside <code>tr</code> elements.</p>

   <pre>var data = {
  name: "Banana",
  cell: document.createElement('td'),
};</pre>

  </div>
