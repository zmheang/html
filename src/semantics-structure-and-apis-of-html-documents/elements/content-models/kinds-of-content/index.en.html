  <h5>Kinds of content</h5>

  <p>Each element in HTML falls into zero or more <dfn data-x="content categories">categories</dfn>
  that group elements with similar characteristics together. The following broad categories are used
  in this specification:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><span>Metadata content</span></li>
   <li><span>Flow content</span></li>
   <li><span>Sectioning content</span></li>
   <li><span>Heading content</span></li>
   <li><span>Phrasing content</span></li>
   <li><span>Embedded content</span></li>
   <li><span>Interactive content</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Some elements also fall into other categories, which are defined in other parts of
  this specification.</p>

  <p>These categories are related as follows:</p>

  <!-- The following image is decorative; the 'as follows' bit above refers to the paragraph after it, which entirely duplicates the content of
       this image. So setting an alt="" on this would be bogus (indeed, it would be non-conforming and bad for accessibility.) -->
  <p><object width="1000" height="288" data="/images/content-venn.svg"><img src="/images/content-venn.png" alt="" width=512 height=288></object></p>

  <p>Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, embedded content, and interactive
  content are all types of flow content. Metadata is sometimes flow content. Metadata and
  interactive content are sometimes phrasing content. Embedded content is also a type of phrasing
  content, and sometimes is interactive content.</p>

  <p>Other categories are also used for specific purposes, e.g. form controls are specified using a
  number of categories to define common requirements. Some elements have unique requirements and do
  not fit into any particular category.</p>
