  <!-- v2: One thing that this doesn't define is handling deeply nested documents. There are
  compatibility requirements around that: you can't throw away the elements altogether, consider Tux
  made only with opening <font> elements, one per character. Seems that the best thing to do is to
  close some formatting elements from the middle of the stack when you hit a limit, or something.
