  <h5><dfn>Character reference state</dfn></h5>

  <p>Set the <var data-x="temporary buffer">temporary buffer</var> to the empty string. Append a
  U+0026 AMPERSAND (&amp;) character to the <var data-x="temporary buffer">temporary buffer</var>.

  <p>Consume the <span>next input character</span>:</p>

   <dt>U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#)</dt>

   <dd>Append the <span>current input character</span> to the <var data-x="temporary
   buffer">temporary buffer</var>. Switch to the <span>numeric character reference
   state</span>.</dd>

   <dt>Anything else</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Consume the maximum number of characters possible, with the consumed characters matching one
    of the identifiers in the first column of the <span>named character references</span> table (in
    a <span>case-sensitive</span> manner). Append each character to the <var data-x="temporary
    buffer">temporary buffer</var> when it's consumed.</p>

    <p>If no match can be made and the <var data-x="temporary buffer">temporary buffer</var>
    consists of a U+0026 AMPERSAND character (&amp;) followed by a sequence of one or more <span
    data-x="ASCII alphanumeric">ASCII alphanumerics</span> and a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;),
    then this is a <span>parse error</span>.</p>

    <p>If no match can be made, switch to the <span>character reference end state</span>.</p>

    <p>If the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute (<var data-x="return
    state">return state</var> is either <span>attribute value (double-quoted) state</span>,
    <span>attribute value (single-quoted) state</span> or <span>attribute value (unquoted)
    state</span>), and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), and the
    <span>next input character</span> is either a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) or an <span>ASCII
    alphanumeric</span>, then, for historical reasons, switch to the <span>character reference end
    state</span>.
    <!-- "=" added because of https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9207#c5 -->

    <p>If the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), this is a <span>parse
    error</span>.</p>

    <p>Set the <var data-x="temporary buffer">temporary buffer</var> to the empty string. Append one
    or two characters corresponding to the character reference name (as given by the second column
    of the <span>named character references</span> table) to the <var data-x="temporary
    buffer">temporary buffer</var>.</p>

    <p>Switch to the <span>character reference end state</span>.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>If the markup contains (not in an attribute) the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I
     tell you</code>, the character reference is parsed as "not", as in, <code data-x="">I'm &not;it;
     I tell you</code> (and this is a parse error). But if the markup was <code data-x="">I'm
     &amp;notin; I tell you</code>, the character reference would be parsed as "notin;", resulting
     in <code data-x="">I'm &notin; I tell you</code> (and no parse error).</p>

     <p>However, if the markup contains the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I tell you</code>
     in an attribute, no character reference is parsed and string remains intact (and there is no
     parse error).</p>
