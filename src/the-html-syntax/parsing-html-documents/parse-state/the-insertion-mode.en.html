  <h5>The insertion mode</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>insertion mode</dfn> is a state variable that controls the primary operation of the
  tree construction stage.</p>

  <p>Initially, the <span>insertion mode</span> is "<span data-x="insertion mode:
  initial">initial</span>". It can change to "<span data-x="insertion mode: before html">before
  html</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: before head">before head</span>", "<span
  data-x="insertion mode: in head">in head</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in head
  noscript">in head noscript</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: after head">after head</span>",
  "<span data-x="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode:
  text">text</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in table">in table</span>", "<span
  data-x="insertion mode: in table text">in table text</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in
  caption">in caption</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in column group">in column
  group</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in table body">in table body</span>", "<span
  data-x="insertion mode: in row">in row</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in cell">in
  cell</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>", "<span data-x="insertion
  mode: in select in table">in select in table</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in
  template">in template</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: after body">after body</span>",
  "<span data-x="insertion mode: in frameset">in frameset</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode:
  after frameset">after frameset</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: after after body">after
  after body</span>", and "<span data-x="insertion mode: after after frameset">after after
  frameset</span>" during the course of the parsing, as described in the <span>tree
  construction</span> stage. The insertion mode affects how tokens are processed and whether CDATA
  sections are supported.</p>

  <p>Several of these modes, namely "<span data-x="insertion mode: in head">in head</span>", "<span
  data-x="insertion mode: in body">in body</span>", "<span data-x="insertion mode: in table">in
  table</span>", and "<span data-x="insertion mode: in select">in select</span>", are special, in
  that the other modes defer to them at various times. When the algorithm below says that the user
  agent is to do something "<dfn>using the rules for</dfn> the <var>m</var> insertion
  mode", where <var>m</var> is one of these modes, the user agent must use the rules
  described under the <var>m</var> <span>insertion mode</span>'s section, but must leave
  the <span>insertion mode</span> unchanged unless the rules in <var>m</var> themselves
  switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to a new value.</p>

  <p>When the insertion mode is switched to "<span data-x="insertion mode: text">text</span>" or
  "<span data-x="insertion mode: in table text">in table text</span>", the <dfn>original insertion
  mode</dfn> is also set. This is the insertion mode to which the tree construction stage will
  return.</p>

  <p>Similarly, to parse nested <code>template</code> elements, a <dfn>stack of template insertion
  modes</dfn> is used. It is initially empty. The <dfn>current template insertion mode</dfn> is the
  insertion mode that was most recently added to the <span>stack of template insertion modes</span>.
  The algorithms in the sections below will <i>push</i> insertion modes onto this stack, meaning
  that the specified insertion mode is to be added to the stack, and <i>pop</i> insertion modes from
  the stack, which means that the most recently added insertion mode must be removed from the
  stack.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reset the insertion mode appropriately</dfn>, it
  means the UA must follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>last</var> be false.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>node</var> be the last node in the <span>stack of open
   elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i>Loop</i>: If <var>node</var> is the first node in the stack of open elements,
   then set <var>last</var> to true, and, if the parser was originally created as part of
   the <span>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</span> (<span>fragment case</span>), set <var>node</var> to the <var data-x="concept-frag-parse-context">context</var>
   element passed to that algorithm.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>node</var> is a <code>select</code> element, run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If <var>last</var> is true, jump to the step below labeled
     <i>done</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>ancestor</var> be <var>node</var>.</p></li>

     <li><p><i>Loop</i>: If <var>ancestor</var> is the first node in the <span>stack of
     open elements</span>, jump to the step below labeled <i>done</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var>ancestor</var> be the node before <var>ancestor</var> in the
     <span>stack of open elements</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>ancestor</var> is a <code>template</code> node, jump to the step below
     labeled <i>done</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>ancestor</var> is a <code>table</code> node, switch the <span>insertion
     mode</span> to "<span data-x="insertion mode: in select in table">in select in table</span>"
     and return.</p></li> <!-- consider
     <table><tr><td><select><template></template><caption></table>

     <li><p>Jump back to the step labeled <i>loop</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p><i>Done</i>: Switch the <span>insertion mode</span> to "<span data-x="insertion mode: in

   <li><p>If <var>node</var> is a <code>td</code> or <code>th</code> element and <var>last</var> is

   <li><p>If <var>node</var> is a <code>caption</code> element, then switch the

   (<span>fragment case</span>)</p></li> --><!-- The above is only here in case people
   think that the spec accidentally omitted it and try to "fix" it. Note that noscript-in-head is
   also handled this way. This is all intentional. The only thing it doesn't handle is the
   scripting-disabled fragment parsing case for a <head> element containing a <noscript> which
   itself contains something other than a <link> or a <style> element; you'd expect that to break
   out of the <noscript> but it doesn't. This is an edge case that doesn't affect the spec, since
   the algorithm for fragment parsing is only used for innerHTML/outerHTML/insertAdjacentHTML(),
   where we know scripting is enabled. -->

   <li><p>If <var>node</var> is a <code>head</code> element and <var>last</var> is
