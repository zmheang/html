  <h5>Other parsing state flags</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>scripting flag</dfn> is set to "enabled" if <span data-x="concept-n-script">scripting
  was enabled</span> for the <code>Document</code> with which the parser is associated when the
  parser was created, and "disabled" otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>scripting flag</span> can be enabled even when the parser was created as
  part of the <span>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</span>, even though <code>script</code> elements
  don't execute in that case.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>frameset-ok flag</dfn> is set to "ok" when the parser is created. It is set to "not
  ok" after certain tokens are seen.</p>
