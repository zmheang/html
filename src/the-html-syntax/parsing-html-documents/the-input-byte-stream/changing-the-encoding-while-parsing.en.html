  <h5>Changing the encoding while parsing</h5>

  <p>When the parser requires the user agent to <dfn>change the encoding</dfn>, it must run the
  following steps. This might happen if the <span>encoding sniffing algorithm</span> described above
  failed to find a character encoding, or if it found a character encoding that was not the actual
  encoding of the file.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the encoding that is already being used to interpret the input stream is a <span>UTF-16
   encoding</span>, then set the <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>certain</i> and return. The new encoding is ignored; if it was anything but the
   same encoding, then it would be clearly incorrect.</p></li>

   <!-- the next two steps are redundant with similar logic in the sniffer -->
   <!-- if you add anything else here, then factor it out into a common algorithm -->

   <li><p>If the new encoding is a <span>UTF-16 encoding</span>, then change it to
   <span>UTF-8</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the new encoding is <span>x-user-defined</span>, then change it to
   <span>windows-1252</span>.</p></li> <!-- apparently this was a Chrome invention, later picked up
   by Mozilla -->

   <li><p>If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding that is already being used
   to interpret the input stream, then set the <span
   data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to <i>certain</i> and return.
   This happens when the encoding information found in the file matches what the <span>encoding
   sniffing algorithm</span> determined to be the encoding, and in the second pass through the
   parser if the first pass found that the encoding sniffing algorithm described in the earlier
   section failed to find the right encoding.</p></li>

   <li><p>If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current decoder have the same
   Unicode interpretations in both the current encoding and the new encoding, and if the user agent
   supports changing the converter on the fly, then the user agent may change to the new converter
   for the encoding on the fly. Set the <span>document's character encoding</span> and the encoding
   used to convert the input stream to the new encoding, set the <span
   data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to <i>certain</i>, and return.</p></li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, <span>navigate</span><!--DONAV reparse--> to the document again, with
   <span>replacement enabled</span>, and using the same <span>source browsing context</span>, but
   this time skip the <span>encoding sniffing algorithm</span> and instead just set the encoding to
   the new encoding and the <span data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to
   <i>certain</i>. Whenever possible, this should be done without actually contacting the network
   layer (the bytes should be re-parsed from memory), even if, e.g., the document is marked as not
   being cacheable. If this is not possible and contacting the network layer would involve repeating
   a request that uses a method other than `<code data-x="">GET</code>`), then instead set the <span
   data-x="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</span> to <i>certain</i> and ignore the new
   encoding. The resource will be misinterpreted. User agents may notify the user of the situation,
   to aid in application development.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">This algorithm is only invoked when a new encoding is found declared on a
  <code>meta</code> element.</p> <!-- this is important for the x-user-defined stuff in particular
  -->
