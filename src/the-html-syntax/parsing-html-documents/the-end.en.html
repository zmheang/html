  <h4>The end</h4>

  <p>Once the user agent <dfn data-x="stop parsing">stops parsing</dfn> the document, the user agent
  must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <!-- this happens as part of one of the tasks that runs the parser -->

   <li><p>Set the <span>current document readiness</span> to "<code data-x="">interactive</code>"
   <!-- this also immediately fires an event --> and the <span>insertion point</span> to
   undefined.</p></li>

   <li><p>Pop <em>all</em> the nodes off the <span>stack of open elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished
   parsing</span> is not empty, run these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p><span>Spin the event loop</span> until the first <code>script</code> in the <span>list
     of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing</span> has its <span>"ready
     to be parser-executed"</span> flag set <em>and</em> the parser's <code>Document</code>
     <span>has no style sheet that is blocking scripts</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p><span data-x="execute the script block">Execute</span> the first <code>script</code> in
     the <span>list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished
     parsing</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Remove the first <code>script</code> element from the <span>list of scripts that will
     execute when the document has finished parsing</span> (i.e. shift out the first entry in the
     list).</p></li>

     <li><p>If the <span>list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished
     parsing</span> is still not empty, repeat these substeps again from substep 1.</p>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code
     data-x="event-DOMContentLoaded">DOMContentLoaded</code> at the <code>Document</code>
     object, with its <code data-x="dom-Event-bubbles">bubbles</code> attribute initialized to
     true.</p></li>

     <li><p>Enable the <span data-x="dfn-client-message-queue">client message queue</span> of the
     <code>ServiceWorkerContainer</code> object whose associated <span
     data-x="serviceworkercontainer-service-worker-client">service worker client</span> is the
     <code>Document</code> object's <span>relevant settings object</span>.</p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p><span>Spin the event loop</span> until the <span>set of scripts that will execute as soon
   as possible</span> and the <span>list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as
   possible</span> are empty.</p></li> <!-- this step is not redundant with the next one, since
   <script> nodes delay the load event of the document they are in, but they might change document
   between being added to one document's set/list and executing those scripts, so they might be
   delaying another document but still be in this document's set/list. -->

   <li><p><span>Spin the event loop</span> until there is nothing that <dfn data-x="delay the load
   event">delays the load event</dfn> in the <code>Document</code>.</p></li>

   <li>

    <p><span>Queue a task</span> to run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Set the <span>current document readiness</span> to "<code data-x="">complete</code>"<!--
     this also fires an event immediately during the task -->.</p></li>

     <li><p><i>Load event</i>: If the <code>Document</code> has a <span
     data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>, then <span
     data-x="concept-event-fire">fire an event</span> named <code data-x="event-load">load</code> at
     the <code>Document</code> object's <code>Window</code> object, with <var>legacy target override
     flag</var> set.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code>Document</code> has a <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing
    context</span>, then <span>queue a task</span> to run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the <code>Document</code>'s <span>page showing</span> flag is true, then return
     (i.e. don't fire the event below).</p></li> <!-- i don't see how this could be, but just
     to be sure... -->

     <li><p>Set the <code>Document</code>'s <span>page showing</span> flag to true.</p></li>

     <li><p><span data-x="concept-event-fire">Fire an event</span> named <code
     data-x="event-pageshow">pageshow</code> at the <code>Document</code> object's
     <code>Window</code> object, using <code>PageTransitionEvent</code>, with the <code
     data-x="dom-PageTransitionEvent-persisted">persisted</code> attribute initialized to false, and
     <var>legacy target override flag</var> set.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li><p>If the <code>Document</code> has any <span>pending application cache download process
   tasks</span>, then <span data-x="queue a task">queue</span> each such <span
   data-x="concept-task">task</span> in the order they were added to the list of <span>pending
   application cache download process tasks</span>, and then empty the list of <span>pending
   application cache download process tasks</span>. The <span>task source</span> for these <span
   data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> is the <span>networking task source</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <code>Document</code>'s <span>print when loaded</span> flag is set, then run the
   <span>printing steps</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code>Document</code> is now <dfn>ready for post-load tasks</dfn>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span> to mark the <code>Document</code> as <dfn>completely
   loaded</dfn>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When the user agent is to <dfn>abort a parser</dfn>, it must run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Throw away any pending content in the <span>input stream</span>, and discard any future
   content that would have been added to it.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>current document readiness</span> to "<code data-x="">interactive</code>"<!--
   this immediately fires an event -->.</p></li>

   <li><p>Pop <em>all</em> the nodes off the <span>stack of open elements</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Set the <span>current document readiness</span> to "<code data-x="">complete</code>"<!--
   this also immediately fires an event -->.</p></li>

   <!-- anything else? this is things that happen when you call document.open() on a document that's
   still being parsed, or when you navigate a document that's still parsing, or navigate the parent
   of a frame with a document that's still parsing, or the user hits "stop". Should the pending
   scripts be blown away or anything? -->

  </ol>

  <p>Except where otherwise specified, the <span>task source</span> for the <span
  data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> mentioned in this section is the <span>DOM manipulation task
  source</span>.</p>
