  <h4>Overview of the parsing model</h4>

  <p class="overview"><object data="/images/parsing-model-overview.svg" width="345" height="535"><img src="/images/parsing-model-overview.png" width="345" height="450" alt=""></object></p>

  <p>The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of <span data-x="Unicode code
  point">Unicode code points</span>, which is passed through a <span>tokenization</span> stage
  followed by a <span>tree construction</span> stage. The output is a <code>Document</code>
  object.</p>

  <p class="note">Implementations that <a href="#non-scripted">do not support scripting</a> do not
  have to actually create a DOM <code>Document</code> object, but the DOM tree in such cases is
  still used as the model for the rest of the specification.</p>

  <p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage comes from the network, but
  <span data-x="dynamic markup insertion">it can also come from script</span> running in the user
  agent, e.g. using the <code data-x="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> API.</p>

  <p id="nestedParsing">There is only one set of states for the tokenizer stage and the tree
  construction stage, but the tree construction stage is reentrant, meaning that while the tree
  construction stage is handling one token, the tokenizer might be resumed, causing further tokens
  to be emitted and processed before the first token's processing is complete.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the tree construction stage will be called upon to handle a "p"
   start tag token while handling the "script" end tag token:</p>

   <pre>...
&lt;script>
 document.write('&lt;p>');
&lt;/script>
...</pre>

  </div>

  <p>To handle these cases, parsers have a <dfn>script nesting level</dfn>, which must be initially
  set to zero, and a <dfn>parser pause flag</dfn>, which must be initially set to false.</p>
