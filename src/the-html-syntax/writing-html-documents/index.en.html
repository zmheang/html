  <h3 id="writing">Writing HTML documents</h3>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p><i>This section only applies to documents, authoring tools, and markup generators. In
  particular, it does not apply to conformance checkers; conformance checkers must use the
  requirements given in the next section ("parsing HTML documents").</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>Documents must consist of the following parts, in the given
  order:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Optionally, a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character.</li>

   <li>Any number of <span data-x="syntax-comments">comments</span> and <span>ASCII
   whitespace</span>.</li>

   <li>A <span data-x="syntax-doctype">DOCTYPE</span>.

   <li>Any number of <span data-x="syntax-comments">comments</span> and <span>ASCII
   whitespace</span>.</li>

   <li>The <span>document element</span>, in the form of an <code>html</code> <span
   data-x="syntax-elements">element</span>.</li>

   <li>Any number of <span data-x="syntax-comments">comments</span> and <span>ASCII
   whitespace</span>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>The various types of content mentioned above are described in the next few sections.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are some restrictions on how <span data-x="character encoding
  declaration">character encoding declarations</span> are to be serialized, as discussed in the
  section on that topic.</p>

  <div class="note">

   <p><span>ASCII whitespace</span> before the <code>html</code> element, at the start of the
   <code>html</code> element and before the <code>head</code> element, will be dropped when the
   document is parsed; <span>ASCII whitespace</span> <em>after</em> the <code>html</code> element
   will be parsed as if it were at the end of the <code>body</code> element. Thus, <span>ASCII
   whitespace</span> around the <span>document element</span> does not round-trip.</p>

   <p>It is suggested that newlines be inserted after the DOCTYPE, after any comments that are
   before the document element, after the <code>html</code> element's start tag (if it is not <span
   data-x="syntax-tag-omission">omitted</span>), and after any comments that are inside the
   <code>html</code> element but before the <code>head</code> element.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Many strings in the HTML syntax (e.g. the names of elements and their attributes) are
  case-insensitive, but only for <span data-x="ASCII upper alpha">ASCII upper alphas</span> and
  <span data-x="ASCII lower alpha">ASCII lower alphas</span>. For convenience, in this section this
  is just referred to as "case-insensitive".</p>
