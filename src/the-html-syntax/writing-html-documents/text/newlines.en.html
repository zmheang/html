  <h5>Newlines</h5>

  <p><dfn data-x="syntax-newlines">Newlines</dfn> in HTML may be represented either as U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, or pairs of U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN (CR), U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters in that order.</p>

  <p>Where <span data-x="syntax-charref">character references</span> are allowed, a character
  reference of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character (but not a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character)
  also represents a <span data-x="syntax-newlines">newline</span>.</p>
