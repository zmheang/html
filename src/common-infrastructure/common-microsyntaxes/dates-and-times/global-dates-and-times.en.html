  <h5>Global dates and times</h5>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="concept-datetime">global date and time</dfn> consists of a specific
  <span>proleptic-Gregorian date</span>, consisting of a year, a month, and a day, and a time,
  consisting of an hour, a minute, a second, and a fraction of a second, expressed with a time-zone
  offset, consisting of a signed number of hours and minutes. <ref spec=GREGORIAN></p>

  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid global date and time string</dfn> representing a date, time, and a
  time-zone offset if it consists of the following components in the given order:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>A <span>valid date string</span> representing the date</li>

   <li>A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T) or a U+0020 SPACE character</li>

   <li>A <span>valid time string</span> representing the time</li>

   <li>A <span>valid time-zone offset string</span> representing the time-zone offset</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Times in dates before the formation of UTC in the mid twentieth century must be expressed and
  interpreted in terms of UT1 (contemporary Earth solar time at the 0&deg; longitude), not UTC (the
  approximation of UT1 that ticks in SI seconds). Time before the formation of time zones must be
  expressed and interpreted as UT1 times with explicit time zones that approximate the contemporary
  difference between the appropriate local time and the time observed at the location of Greenwich,
  London.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following are some examples of dates written as <span data-x="valid global date and time
   string">valid global date and time strings</span>.</p>

   <dl>

    <dt>"<code data-x="">0037-12-13 00:00Z</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Midnight in areas using London time on the birthday of Nero (the Roman Emperor). See below
    for further discussion on which date this actually corresponds to.</dd>

    <dt>"<code data-x="">1979-10-14T12:00:00.001-04:00</code>"</dt>

    <dd>One millisecond after noon on October 14th 1979, in the time zone in use on the east coast
    of the USA during daylight saving time.</dd>

    <dt>"<code data-x="">8592-01-01T02:09+02:09</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Midnight UTC on the 1st of January, 8592. The time zone associated with that time is two
    hours and nine minutes ahead of UTC, which is not currently a real time zone, but is nonetheless
    allowed.</dd>

   </dl>

   <p>Several things are notable about these dates:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>Years with fewer than four digits have to be zero-padded. The date "37-12-13" would not be a
    valid date.</li>

    <li>If the "<code data-x="">T</code>" is replaced by a space, it must be a single space
    character. The string "<code data-x="">2001-12-21&nbsp;&nbsp;12:00Z</code>" (with two spaces
    between the components) would not be parsed successfully.</li>

    <li>To unambiguously identify a moment in time prior to the introduction of the Gregorian
    calendar (insofar as moments in time before the formation of UTC can be unambiguously
    identified), the date has to be first converted to the Gregorian calendar from the calendar in
    use at the time (e.g. from the Julian calendar). The date of Nero's birth is the 15th of
    December 37, in the Julian Calendar, which is the 13th of December 37 in the <span>proleptic
    Gregorian calendar</span>.</li> <!-- This might not be true. I can't find a reference that gives
    his birthday with an explicit statement about the calendar being used. However, it seems
    unlikely that it would be given in the Gregorian calendar, so I assume sites use the Julian one.
    -->

    <li>The time and time-zone offset components are not optional.</li>

    <li>Dates before the year one can't be represented as a datetime in this version of HTML.</li>

    <li>Times of specific events in ancient times are, at best, approximations, since time was not
    well coordinated or measured until relatively recent decades.</li>

    <li>Time-zone offsets differ based on daylight saving time.</li>

   </ul>

  <p>The rules to <dfn>parse a global date and time string</dfn> are as follows. This will return
  either a time in UTC, with associated time-zone offset information for round-tripping or display
  purposes, or nothing. If at any point the algorithm says that it "fails", this means that it is
  aborted at that point and returns nothing.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially
   pointing at the start of the string.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Parse a date component</span> to obtain <var>year</var>, <var>month</var>, and <var>day</var>. If this returns nothing, then fail.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>position</var> is beyond the end of <var>input</var> or if the
   character at <var>position</var> is neither a U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character
   (T) nor a U+0020 SPACE character, then fail. Otherwise, move <var>position</var>
   forwards one character.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Parse a time component</span> to obtain <var>hour</var>, <var>minute</var>, and <var>second</var>. If this returns nothing, then fail.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>position</var> is beyond the end of <var>input</var>, then
   fail.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Parse a time-zone offset component</span> to obtain <var>timezone<sub>hours</sub></var> and <var>timezone<sub>minutes</sub></var>. If this
   returns nothing, then fail.</p>

   <li><p>If <var>position</var> is <em>not</em> beyond the end of <var>input</var>, then fail.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>time</var> be the moment in time at year <var>year</var>, month
   <var>month</var>, day <var>day</var>, hours <var>hour</var>, minute
   <var>minute</var>, second <var>second</var>, subtracting <var>timezone<sub>hours</sub></var> hours and <var>timezone<sub>minutes</sub></var> minutes. That moment in time is a moment in the UTC time
   zone.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>timezone</var> be <var>timezone<sub>hours</sub></var>
   hours and <var>timezone<sub>minutes</sub></var> minutes from UTC.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var>time</var> and <var>timezone</var>.</p></li>
