  <h4>Interactions with XPath and XSLT</h4>

  <p id="xpath-1.0-processors">Implementations of XPath 1.0 that operate on <span>HTML
  documents</span> parsed or created in the manners described in this specification (e.g. as part of
  the <code data-x="">document.evaluate()</code> API) must act as if the following edit was applied
  to the XPath 1.0 specification.</p>

  <p>First, remove this paragraph:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/#node-tests">

   <p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">QName</a> in the node test is expanded
   into an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/#dt-expanded-name">expanded-name</a>
   using the namespace declarations from the expression context. This is the same way expansion is
   done for element type names in start and end-tags except that the default namespace declared with
   <code data-x="">xmlns</code> is not used: if the <a
   href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">QName</a> does not have a prefix, then the
   namespace URI is null (this is the same way attribute names are expanded). It is an error if the
   <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">QName</a> has a prefix for which there is
   no namespace declaration in the expression context.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Then, insert in its place the following:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7059#c37">

   <p>A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations
   from the expression context. If the QName has a prefix, then there must be a<!-- added 2009-10-27
   - https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8062 --> namespace declaration for this prefix in
   the expression context, and the corresponding<!-- typo fixed 2009-10-27 -
   https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8063 --> namespace URI is the one that is
   associated with this prefix. It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no
   namespace declaration in the expression context. </p>

   <p>If the QName has no prefix and the principal node type of the axis is element, then the
   default element namespace is used. Otherwise if the QName has no prefix, the namespace URI is
   null. The default element namespace is a member of the context for the XPath expression. The
   value of the default element namespace when executing an XPath expression through the DOM3 XPath
   API is determined in the following way:</p>

   <ol>
    <li>If the context node is from an HTML DOM, the default element namespace is
    "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml".</li>

    <li>Otherwise, the default element namespace URI is null.</li>
   </ol>

   <p class="note">This is equivalent to adding the default element namespace feature of XPath 2.0
   to XPath 1.0, and using the HTML namespace as the default element namespace for HTML documents.
   It is motivated by the desire to have implementations be compatible with legacy HTML content
   while still supporting the changes that this specification introduces to HTML regarding the
   namespace used for HTML elements, and by the desire to use XPath 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="note">This change is a <span>willful violation</span> of the XPath 1.0 specification,
  motivated by desire to have implementations be compatible with legacy content while still
  supporting the changes that this specification introduces to HTML regarding which namespace is
  used for HTML elements. <ref spec=XPATH10></p> <!-- note: version matters for
  this ref -->

  <hr>

  <p id="dom-based-xslt-1.0-processors">XSLT 1.0 processors outputting to a DOM when the output
  method is "html" (either explicitly or via the defaulting rule in XSLT 1.0) are affected as
  follows:</p>

  <p>If the transformation program outputs an element in no namespace, the processor must, prior to
  constructing the corresponding DOM element node, change the namespace of the element to the
  <span>HTML namespace</span>, <span data-x="converted to ASCII lowercase">ASCII-lowercase</span> the
  element's local name, and <span data-x="converted to ASCII lowercase">ASCII-lowercase</span> the
  names of any non-namespaced attributes on the element.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is a <span>willful violation</span> of the XSLT 1.0
  specification, required because this specification changes the namespaces and case-sensitivity
  rules of HTML in a manner that would otherwise be incompatible with DOM-based XSLT
  transformations. (Processors that serialize the output are unaffected.) <ref spec=XSLT10></p> <!--
  note: version matters for this ref -->

  <hr>

  <p>This specification does not specify precisely how XSLT processing interacts with the <span>HTML
  parser</span> infrastructure (for example, whether an XSLT processor acts as if it puts any
  elements into a <span>stack of open elements</span>). However, XSLT processors must <span>stop
  parsing</span> if they successfully complete, and must set the <span>current document
  readiness</span> first to "<code data-x="">interactive</code>"<!-- this synchronously fires an
  event --> and then to "<code data-x="">complete</code>"<!-- this also synchronously fires an event
  --> if they are aborted.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>This specification does not specify how XSLT interacts with the <span
  data-x="navigate">navigation</span> algorithm, how it fits in with the <span>event loop</span>, nor
  how error pages are to be handled (e.g. whether XSLT errors are to replace an incremental XSLT
  output, or are rendered inline, etc).</p>

  <p class="note">There are also additional non-normative comments regarding the interaction of XSLT
  and HTML <a href="#scriptTagXSLT">in the <code>script</code> element section</a>, and of
  XSLT, XPath, and HTML <a href="#template-XSLT-XPath">in the <code>template</code> element
  section</a>.</p>
