  <h4>Extensibility</h4>

  <p>Vendor-specific proprietary user agent extensions to this specification are strongly
  discouraged. Documents must not use such extensions, as doing so reduces interoperability and
  fragments the user base, allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in
  question.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>All extensions must be defined so that the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
  non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.</p> <!-- thanks to QA Framework -->

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, while strongly discouraged from doing so, an implementation could add a new IDL
   attribute "<code data-x="">typeTime</code>" to a control that returned the time it took the user
   to select the current value of a control (say). On the other hand, defining a new control that
   appears in a form's <code data-x="dom-form-elements">elements</code> array would be in violation
   of the above requirement, as it would violate the definition of <code
   data-x="dom-form-elements">elements</code> given in this specification.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed, either this specification can
  be updated accordingly, or an extension specification can be written that overrides the
  requirements in this specification. When someone applying this specification to their activities
  decides that they will recognize the requirements of such an extension specification, it becomes
  an <dfn data-x="other applicable specifications">applicable specification</dfn> for the purposes
  of conformance requirements in this specification.</p>

  <p class="note">Someone could write a specification that defines any arbitrary byte stream as
  conforming, and then claim that their random junk is conforming. However, that does not mean that
  their random junk actually is conforming for everyone's purposes: if someone else decides that
  that specification does not apply to their work, then they can quite legitimately say that the
  aforementioned random junk is just that, junk, and not conforming at all. As far as conformance
  goes, what matters in a particular community is what that community <em>agrees</em> is
  applicable.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <hr>

  <p>User agents must treat elements and attributes that they do not understand as semantically
  neutral; leaving them in the DOM (for DOM processors), and styling them according to CSS (for CSS
  processors), but not inferring any meaning from them.</p>

<!--ADD-TOPIC:Security-->
  <p>When support for a feature is disabled (e.g. as an emergency measure to mitigate a security
  problem, or to aid in development, or for performance reasons), user agents must act as if they
  had no support for the feature whatsoever, and as if the feature was not mentioned in this
  specification. For example, if a particular feature is accessed via an attribute in a Web IDL
  interface, the attribute itself would be omitted from the objects that implement that interface
  &mdash; leaving the attribute on the object but making it return null or throw an exception is
  insufficient.</p>
