  <h3>Frames and framesets</h3>

  <p>User agent are expected to render <code>frameset</code> elements as a box with the height and
  width of the <span>viewport</span>, with a surface rendered according to the following layout
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>The <var>cols</var> and <var>rows</var> variables are lists of zero or more pairs consisting
    of a number and a unit, the unit being one of <i>percentage</i>, <i>relative</i>, and
    <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Use the <span>rules for parsing a list of dimensions</span> to parse the value of the
    element's <code undefined data-x="attr-frameset-cols">cols</code> attribute, if there is one.
    Let <var>cols</var> be the result, or an empty list if there is no such attribute.</p>

    <p>Use the <span>rules for parsing a list of dimensions</span> to parse the value of the
    element's <code undefined data-x="attr-frameset-rows">rows</code> attribute, if there is one.
    Let <var>rows</var> be the result, or an empty list if there is no such attribute.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For any of the entries in <var>cols</var> or <var>rows</var> that have the number zero and
    the unit <i>relative</i>, change the entry's number to one.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>cols</var> has no entries, then add a single entry consisting of the value 1 and the
    unit <i>relative</i> to <var>cols</var>.</p>

    <p>If <var>rows</var> has no entries, then add a single entry consisting of the value 1 and the
    unit <i>relative</i> to <var>rows</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Invoke the algorithm defined below to <span>convert a list of dimensions to a list of pixel
    values</span> using <var>cols</var> as the input list, and the width of the surface that the
    <code>frameset</code> is being rendered into, in <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>, as the
    input dimension. Let <var>sized cols</var> be the resulting list.</p>

    <p>Invoke the algorithm defined below to <span>convert a list of dimensions to a list of pixel
    values</span> using <var>rows</var> as the input list, and the height of the surface that the
    <code>frameset</code> is being rendered into, in <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>, as the
    input dimension. Let <var>sized rows</var> be the resulting list.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Split the surface into a grid of <var>w</var>&times;<var>h</var>
    rectangles, where <var>w</var> is the number of entries in <var>sized cols</var> and
    <var>h</var> is the number of entries in <var>sized rows</var>.</p>

    <p>Size the columns so that each column in the grid is as many <span data-x="'px'">CSS
    pixels</span> wide as the corresponding entry in the <var>sized cols</var> list.</p>

    <p>Size the rows so that each row in the grid is as many <span data-x="'px'">CSS pixels</span>
    high as the corresponding entry in the <var>sized rows</var> list.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>children</var> be the list of <code>frame</code> and <code>frameset</code> elements
    that are <span data-x="concept-tree-child">children</span> of the <code>frameset</code> element
    for which the algorithm was invoked.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For each row of the grid of rectangles created in the previous step, from top to bottom, run
    these substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li>

      <p>For each rectangle in the row, from left to right, run these substeps:</p>

      <ol>

       <li>

        <p>If there are any elements left in <var>children</var>, take the first element in the
        list, and assign it to the rectangle.</p>

        <p>If this is a <code>frameset</code> element, then recurse the entire <code>frameset</code>
        layout algorithm for that <code>frameset</code> element, with the rectangle as the
        surface.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, it is a <code>frame</code> element; render its <span>nested browsing
        context</span>, positioned and sized to fit the rectangle.</p>

       </li>

       <li>

        <p>If there are any elements left in <var>children</var>, remove the first element from
        <var>children</var>.</p>

       </li>

      </ol>

     </li>

    </ol>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If the <code>frameset</code> element <span>has a border</span>, draw an outer set of borders
    around the rectangles, using the element's <span>frame border color</span>.</p>

    <p>For each rectangle, if there is an element assigned to that rectangle, and that element
    <span>has a border</span>, draw an inner set of borders around that rectangle, using the
    element's <span>frame border color</span>.</p>

    <p>For each (visible) border that does not abut a rectangle that is assigned a
    <code>frame</code> element with a <code undefined data-x="attr-frame-noresize">noresize</code>
    attribute (including rectangles in further nested <code>frameset</code> elements), the user
    agent is expected to allow the user to move the border, resizing the rectangles within, keeping
    the proportions of any nested <code>frameset</code> grids.</p>

    <p>A <code>frameset</code> or <code>frame</code> element <dfn>has a border</dfn> if the
    following algorithm returns true:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the element has a <code data-x="">frameborder</code> attribute whose value is not the
     empty string and whose first character is either a U+0031 DIGIT ONE (1) character, a U+0079
     LATIN SMALL LETTER Y character (y), or a U+0059 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y character (Y), then
     return true.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a <code data-x="">frameborder</code> attribute, return
     false.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a parent element that is a <code>frameset</code> element,
     then return true if <em>that</em> element <span>has a border</span>, and false if it does
     not.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, return true.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>The <!--en-GB--><dfn id="frame-border-colour">frame border color</dfn> of a
    <code>frameset</code> or <code>frame</code> element is the color obtained from the following
    algorithm:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><p>If the element has a <code data-x="">bordercolor</code> attribute, and applying the
     <span>rules for parsing a legacy color value</span> to that attribute's value does not result
     in an error, then return the color so obtained.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, if the element has a parent element that is a <code>frameset</code> element,
     then return the <span>frame border color</span> of that element.</p>

     <li><p>Otherwise, return gray.</p></li>

    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

  <p>The algorithm to <dfn>convert a list of dimensions to a list of pixel values</dfn> consists of
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>input list</var> be the list of numbers and units passed to the algorithm.</p>

    <p>Let <var>output list</var> be a list of numbers the same length as <var>input list</var>, all
    zero.</p>

    <p>Entries in <var>output list</var> correspond to the entries in <var>input list</var> that
    have the same position.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var>input dimension</var> be the size passed to the algorithm.</p>

   <li>

    <p>Let <var>count percentage</var> be the number of entries in <var>input list</var> whose unit
    is <i>percentage</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>total percentage</var> be the sum of all the numbers in <var>input list</var> whose
    unit is <i>percentage</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>count relative</var> be the number of entries in <var>input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>relative</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>total relative</var> be the sum of all the numbers in <var>input list</var> whose
    unit is <i>relative</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>count absolute</var> be the number of entries in <var>input list</var> whose unit is
    <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>total absolute</var> be the sum of all the numbers in <var>input list</var> whose
    unit is <i>absolute</i>.</p>

    <p>Let <var>remaining space</var> be the value of <var>input dimension</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>total absolute</var> is greater than <var>remaining space</var>, then for each entry
    in <var>input list</var> whose unit is <i>absolute</i>, set the corresponding value in
    <var>output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var>input list</var> multiplied by
    <var>remaining space</var> and divided by <var>total absolute</var>. Then, set <var>remaining
    space</var> to zero.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, for each entry in <var>input list</var> whose unit is <i>absolute</i>, set the
    corresponding value in <var>output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var>input
    list</var>. Then, decrement <var>remaining space</var> by <var>total absolute</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>If <var>total percentage</var> multiplied by the <var>input dimension</var> and divided by
    100 is greater than <var>remaining space</var>, then for each entry in <var>input list</var>
    whose unit is <i>percentage</i>, set the corresponding value in <var>output list</var> to the
    number of the entry in <var>input list</var> multiplied by <var>remaining space</var> and
    divided by <var>total percentage</var>. Then, set <var>remaining space</var> to zero.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, for each entry in <var>input list</var> whose unit is <i>percentage</i>, set the
    corresponding value in <var>output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var>input
    list</var> multiplied by the <var>input dimension</var> and divided by 100. Then, decrement
    <var>remaining space</var> by <var>total percentage</var> multiplied by the <var>input
    dimension</var> and divided by 100.</p>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For each entry in <var>input list</var> whose unit is <i>relative</i>, set the corresponding
    value in <var>output list</var> to the number of the entry in <var>input list</var> multiplied
    by <var>remaining space</var> and divided by <var>total relative</var>.</p>

   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>output list</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>User agents working with integer values for frame widths (as opposed to user agents that can
  lay frames out with subpixel accuracy) are expected to distribute the remainder first to the last
  entry whose unit is <i>relative</i>, then equally (not proportionally) to each entry whose unit is
  <i>percentage</i>, then equally (not proportionally) to each entry whose unit is <i>absolute</i>,
  and finally, failing all else, to the last entry.</p>

  <hr>

<!--
  <p>The user agent is expected to force the <span>'display'</span> property of <code>frame</code>
  elements to 'block', the <span>'height'</span> property of <code>frame</code> elements to 0, and
  the <span>'width'</span> property of <code>frame</code> elements to 0, irrespective of CSS rules.
  (This only matters for when a <code>frame</code> element is rendered outside a
  <code>frameset</code>.)</p>

-->

  <p>The contents of a <code>frame</code> element that does not have a <code>frameset</code> parent
  are expected to be rendered as transparent black; the user agent is expected to not render the
  <span>nested browsing context</span> in this case, and that <span>nested browsing context</span>
  is expected to have a <span>viewport</span> with zero width and zero height.</p>
