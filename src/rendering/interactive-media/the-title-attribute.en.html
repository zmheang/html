  <h4>The <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute</h4>

  <p>User agents are expected to expose the <span>advisory information</span> of elements upon user
  request, and to make the user aware of the presence of such information.</p>

  <p>On interactive graphical systems where the user can use a pointing device, this could take the
  form of a tooltip. When the user is unable to use a pointing device, then the user agent is
  expected to make the content available in some other fashion, e.g. by making the element a
  <span>focusable area</span> and always displaying the <span>advisory information</span> of the
  currently <span>focused</span> element, or by showing the <span>advisory information</span> of the
  elements under the user's finger on a touch device as the user pans around the screen.</p>

  <p>U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are expected to cause line breaks in the tooltip; U+0009
  CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters are expected to render as a nonzero horizontal shift that
  lines up the next glyph with the next tab stop, with tab stops occurring at points that are
  multiples of 8 times the width of a U+0020 SPACE character.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, a visual user agent could make elements with a <code
   data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute <span>focusable</span>, and could make
   any <span>focused</span> element with a <code data-x="attr-title">title</code> attribute
   show its tooltip under the element while the element has focus. This would allow a user to tab
   around the document to find all the advisory text.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>As another example, a screen reader could provide an audio cue when reading an element with a
   tooltip, with an associated key to read the last tooltip for which a cue was played.</p>

  </div>
