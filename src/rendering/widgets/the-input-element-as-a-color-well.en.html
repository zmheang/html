  <!--en-GB--><h4 id="the-input-element-as-a-colour-well">The <code>input</code> element as a color
  well</h4>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span data-x="attr-input-type-color">Color</span> state is expected to render as an
  <span>'inline-block'</span> box depicting a color well, which, when activated, provides the user
  with a color picker (e.g. a color wheel or color palette) from which the color can be
  changed.</p>

  <p>Predefined suggested values (provided by the <code data-x="attr-input-list">list</code>
  attribute) are expected to be shown in the color picker interface, not on the color well
  itself.</p>
