  <h4>The <code>marquee</code> element</h4>

  <pre><code class="css">@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

marquee {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: initial;
}</code></pre>

  <p>The <code>marquee</code> element, while <span data-x="concept-marquee-on">turned on</span>, is
  expected to render in an animated fashion according to its attributes as follows:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>If the element's <code data-x="attr-marquee-behavior">behavior</code> attribute is in the
   <span data-x="attr-marquee-behavior-scroll">scroll</span> state</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Slide the contents of the element in the direction described by the <code
    data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute as defined below, such that it begins
    off the start side of the <code>marquee</code>, and ends flush with the inner end side.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, if the <code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code>
    attribute is <span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-left">left</span> (the default), then the
    contents would start such that their left edge are off the side of the right edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>, and the contents would then slide up to the
    point where the left edge of the contents are flush with the left inner edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>.</p>

    <p>Once the animation has ended, the user agent is expected to <span>increment the marquee
    current loop index</span>. If the element is still <span data-x="concept-marquee-on">turned
    on</span> after this, then the user agent is expected to restart the animation.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>If the element's <code data-x="attr-marquee-behavior">behavior</code> attribute is in the
   <span data-x="attr-marquee-behavior-slide">slide</span> state</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Slide the contents of the element in the direction described by the <code
    data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute as defined below, such that it begins
    off the start side of the <code>marquee</code>, and ends off the end side of the
    <code>marquee</code>.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, if the <code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code>
    attribute is <span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-left">left</span> (the default), then the
    contents would start such that their left edge are off the side of the right edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>, and the contents would then slide up to the
    point where the <em>right</em> edge of the contents are flush with the left inner edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>.</p>

    <p>Once the animation has ended, the user agent is expected to <span>increment the marquee
    current loop index</span>. If the element is still <span data-x="concept-marquee-on">turned
    on</span> after this, then the user agent is expected to restart the animation.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>If the element's <code data-x="attr-marquee-behavior">behavior</code> attribute is in the
   <span data-x="attr-marquee-behavior-alternate">alternate</span> state</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>When the <span>marquee current loop index</span> is even (or zero), slide the contents of the
    element in the direction described by the <code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code>
    attribute as defined below, such that it begins flush with the start side of the
    <code>marquee</code>, and ends flush with the end side of the <code>marquee</code>.</p>

    <p>When the <span>marquee current loop index</span> is odd, slide the contents of the element in
    the opposite direction than that described by the <code
    data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute as defined below, such that it begins
    flush with the end side of the <code>marquee</code>, and ends flush with the start side of the
    <code>marquee</code>.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, if the <code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code>
    attribute is <span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-left">left</span> (the default), then the
    contents would with their right edge flush with the right inner edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>, and the contents would then slide up to the
    point where the <em>left</em> edge of the contents are flush with the left inner edge of the
    <code>marquee</code>'s <span>content area</span>.</p>

    <p>Once the animation has ended, the user agent is expected to <span>increment the marquee
    current loop index</span>. If the element is still <span data-x="concept-marquee-on">turned
    on</span> after this, then the user agent is expected to continue the animation.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute has the meanings described
  in the following table:</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th><code data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute state
     <th>Direction of animation
     <th>Start edge
     <th>End edge
     <th>Opposite direction
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-left">left</span>
     <td>&larr; Right to left
     <td>Right
     <td>Left
     <td>&rarr; Left to Right
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-right">right</span>
     <td>&rarr; Left to Right
     <td>Left
     <td>Right
     <td>&larr; Right to left
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-up">up</span>
     <td>&uarr; Up (Bottom to Top)
     <td>Bottom
     <td>Top
     <td>&darr; Down (Top to Bottom)
    <tr>
     <td><span data-x="attr-marquee-direction-down">down</span>
     <td>&darr; Down (Top to Bottom)
     <td>Top
     <td>Bottom
     <td>&uarr; Up (Bottom to Top)
  </table>

  <p>In any case, the animation should proceed such that there is a delay given by the <span>marquee
  scroll interval</span> between each frame, and such that the content moves at most the distance
  given by the <span>marquee scroll distance</span> with each frame.</p>

  <p>When a <code>marquee</code> element has a <code undefined data-x="attr-marquee-bgcolor">bgcolor</code>
  attribute set, the value is expected to be parsed using the <span>rules for parsing a legacy color
  value</span>, and if that does not return an error, the user agent is expected to treat the
  attribute as a <span data-x="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> setting the element's
  <span>'background-color'</span> property to the resulting color.</p>

  <p>The <code undefined data-x="attr-marquee-width">width</code> and <code
  undefined data-x="attr-marquee-height">height</code> attributes on a <code>marquee</code> element
  <span data-x="maps to the dimension property">map to the dimension properties</span>
  <span>'width'</span> and <span>'height'</span> on the element respectively.</p>

  <p>The <span>intrinsic height</span> of a <code>marquee</code> element with its <code
  data-x="attr-marquee-direction">direction</code> attribute in the <span
  data-x="attr-marquee-direction-up">up</span> or <span
  data-x="attr-marquee-direction-down">down</span> states is 200 <span data-x="'px'">CSS
  pixels</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code undefined data-x="attr-marquee-vspace">vspace</code> attribute of a
  <code>marquee</code> element <span data-x="maps to the dimension property">maps to the dimension
  properties</span> <span>'margin-top'</span> and <span>'margin-bottom'</span> on the element. The
  <code undefined data-x="attr-marquee-hspace">hspace</code> attribute of a <code>marquee</code>
  element <span data-x="maps to the dimension property">maps to the dimension properties</span>
  <span>'margin-left'</span> and <span>'margin-right'</span> on the element.</p>

  <p>The <span>'overflow'</span> property on the <code>marquee</code> element is expected to be
  ignored; overflow is expected to always be hidden.</p>
